As soon as they start removing content due to any pressure group they’ll find themselves constantly being inundated with content removal mobs. This would include groups beyond lefitst cultural warriors, including right wing cultural warriors, every religious group, and every other activist group that finds content that offends their sensibilities.

They’ll either have to consistently cave to every mob or they’ll be accused of bias. If they remove content at the bequest of Christians, but not Muslims, then they’ll be rightfully accused of religious bias. Soon they’ll find themselves losing subscribers due to their demonstrated bias.

Netflix doesn’t just want to cater to a small slice of global culture, but instead wants to be the go to streaming platform for everyone. They will always have some content that offends somebody; it’s possible that most people could find a single Netflix title that offends them in some way due Netflix’s massive library.

We already have a fair amount of infighting between the progressives and the moderates. Having Dem leadership explicitly move towards the center on cultural issues would certainly incite condemnation by progressive leaders. In the extreme case we could even split the party and that would ensure Republican electoral success for the foreseeable future.

Instead, I think we need substantially better messaging that softens wedge issues by tying them to general issues with broad appeal. E.g., when discussing racial disparities, we could tie these disparities into general economic inequality issues. Our leadership can then lean into contentious issues without making them dividing issues; instead we’ll present the issues as uniting. We wouldn’t downplay contentious issues, e.g., taking a class reductionist approach for racial issues, but instead present them as one facet of common shared issues faced by the majority of Americans.

Along with this uniting approach, I think Dem leadership should proactive wrap ourselves in the flag. We could appeal to general American values, e.g., life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, when presenting our message. We should lean into patriotism when presenting our commitment to addressing issues such as racial disparities and economic inequality."

Further, investors are generally rotating away from fossil fuels for ESG reasons, including concerns that the sector will unprofitable as major countries take measures to curb carbon emissions. See Matt Levine's ""Nobody Is Drilling the Oil"" [1]

> One way to tell that story is that, influenced by Fink and others, investors now insist on long-term sustainability. They believe that a zero-carbon world is coming, they want to invest in companies that will make money in a zero-carbon world, and they think that a lot of marginal oil drillers will not survive in that world. The oil drillers might agree! “We’re gonna drill for oil for 10 years, sell it at $85 a barrel, make a lot of money for our investors, and then close up shop when the world moves off oil” is a perfectly reasonable business plan. But — Schwarzman says — investors will not finance it anymore, because they are myopically obsessed with the long run.

I also find this quote from Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield [2] insightful to how the industry thinks,

> I don’t think they realize what’s changed in the U.S. is our investors want cash back. Investors do not want us to grow anymore. If he [Biden] wants us to change he’s got to change that investor mindset.

45073472,A boring post about how monetary policy works,https://www.slowboring.com/p/monetary-mechanism,3949338,Matt Hagy,3094604,2021-12-10 07:46:10-05:00,2,0,1,,,3949338,1,,,"Great high-level explanation of central banking and theories of how it impacts the economy, including the hydraulic vs. expectations theories. While I agree that the expectation mechanism is the primary way that central banks (CBs) affect economic conditions, I think that only works because there are very real hydraulic mechanisms. QE and short term interest rate targets (via open market operations) very much do influence the financial markets. This includes both short term immediate changes in the cost of capital and long term expectations.

For example, when a CB institutes QE, they do increase the demand for longer maturity government debt; i.e., treasury notes/bonds. The increase in demand causes an increase in price, which leads to lower yields (i.e., lower interest rates on government debt).

This can be illustrated with a contrived and simplified example. Say that before QE, a 1 year T-bill with a face value of $100, and no interest payments (zero coupon bond) was trading at $95. That would give it an effective annual rate of 5%. Say that the QE program includes purchasing such 1 year T-bills and the CB purchases sufficient T-bills such that the increase in demand at constant supply causes them to now trade at $97, reducing the yield to 3%. This QE has a real world impact of reducing the safe yield one could get from a T-bill maturing in one year.

Further, such changes in the government debt market have spillover effects into other markets. Some investors who would’ve purchased 1 year T-bills will now find that these bonds have insufficient yield for their investment needs. Instead, the investor will move into riskier, yet still relatively safe, high-quality corporate debt; investment grade bonds. Since these bonds are relatively riskier than the risk-free government debt, they always have to offer higher yields. Some investors will be tempted to seek these higher yields and assume greater risk.

Additionally, investors who already held 1 year T-bills before QE will be tempted to sell them for a nice short term profit. E.g., a T-bill bought yesterday for $95 can be sold today for $97 for an excellent short term profit. Yet the seller now has to find something to do with that cash. They too may seek risker, yet higher yielding, corporate bonds.

And the spillover effect continues. The higher demand for investment grade bonds will cause their yields to also fall. Some investors will migrate from investment grade bonds to junk bonds; i.e., riskier bonds from firms with worse credit ratings. Again, there’s spillover, with lower yields across all classes of bonds pushing investors into equities; i.e., stocks. Stocks themselves have various risk levels, and there will be a spillover throughout risk classes. At the end, we get higher demand for the riskiest of investments; e.g., venture capital and speculative assets such as crypto.

And again, these real hydraulic impacts influence expectations. Many investors will preemptively shift into riskier assets before an expected loosening of monetary policy influences yields across all classes of investments. The hydraulic and expectation forces also work in reverse with investors rotating into safer assets with a tightening of monetary policies.

I also think that it is noteworthy that the loosening of monetary policy induces a greater demand for riskier financial assets. There’s a lot that we could all discuss around the pros and cons of increased speculation, but I’ll end this long comment without adding my thoughts on that."

E.g., CTC ends after 2022 and SALT cap reinstated in 2025. Alternatively, if BBB policies are made permanent, the CBO estimates a $3 trillion deficit. [1] Such a larger increase in deficit spending would entail a large stimulating effect on the economy.

I think it's well accepted that we put in these expirations with the expectations that the programs would be extended, but we needed to minimize the deficit spending to get this through recon. I haven't seen any proposals from Dem leadership for how we hope to handle that in the future, assuming we even have sufficient Ds in Congress. Hence, I think it reasonable to assume that at least some of these programs will be extended and at least partially paid for through additional deficit spending.

Still agree that the overall impact of BBB on inflation will be minor. Yet, if we truly were concerned about inflation and wanted to use fiscal tools to combat inflation we'd be increasing taxes. Possibly even front loading a tax revenue surplus with later deficit spending in the 10 year plan. That of course would be political suicide.

Further, I imagine many of these parents, rightfully or wrongfully, believe their children are “academically gifted” and would thereby be impacted by such policy changes.

As more upper middle class families move out of the public education system they’ll be far less invested in politicians' education policies when they go to vote. Not only will they care less about ensuring the schools are well funded, but they may also be motivated to vote for misguided educational programs that are well marketed. E.g., the current proposed changes in the name of equity that are unlikely to improve the education of historically disadvantaged groups.

The result would be a positive feedback loop whereby CA’s public education system increasingly becomes a hobby project for affluent voters to demonstrate their commitment to socially progressive values without any concern for educational outcomes of the marginalized students who are subjected to our fancifulness."

Such a basic statistics course could be valuable to students understanding how to interpret statistics in the news and other parts of life.

Instead, maybe the course could be taught alongside algebra and be less focused on the math underlying statistics but more focused on practical applications of stats. I could imagine a valuable course that focuses on stats and financial literacy taught somewhere around 8th grade. Lessons would include actual stats reported in the news and the class would work through how to interpret them. There could even be examples of misleading news stories that misuse states.

Yet I do believe any student interested in a mathematical understanding of statistics will need to first take calculus before beginning a “proper” stats course. It’s just that so much of stats involves integration; i.e., area under the curve. Further, I don’t think one can fully appreciate a lot of important math concepts, including p-values and statistical significance, until they have some background in calculus.

See Bloomberg’s Nov 6th article, “Rise of the Robots Speeds Up in Pandemic With U.S. Labor Scarce”. [1] This will hopefully lead to a continuous boom in productivity and further enrich our populace with extremely low cost goods and services.

> Labor shortages and rising wages are pushing U.S. business to invest in automation. A recent Federal Reserve survey of chief financial officers found that at firms with difficulty hiring, one-third are implementing or exploring automation to replace workers. In earnings calls over the past month, executives from a range of businesses confirmed the trend.

I’m particularly hoping that the port congestion will finally gives us the political capital to upgrade our legacy ports

> Unions have long seen automation as a threat. At U.S. ports, which lag their global peers in technology and are currently at the center of a major supply-chain crisis, the International Longshoremen’s Association has vowed to fight it. 

I recently read about a similar historical event whereby a shrinking labor supply forced industry to invest in automation with extreme and positive long term effects on society: the productionization of the spindle cotton picker in the late 1930s. [2] 

>  Eli Whitney’s cotton gin had created the Cotton South, but the Rust picker threatened to destroy it. 

This invention accelerated the northern migration of black laborers to industrial jobs and out of the extreme poverty of substance sharecropping. Whereas previously the white establishment had implemented brutal measures to fight black migration and thereby maintain their exploited labor supply, the mechanization of cotton picking changed the incentives. In some cases, the local white establishment reversed their position and started to encourage black migration north due to their racist hatred.

You can read more about the social impact of this technological revolution in David Halberstam’s,  “The Fifties”. There’s an excerpt on this specific chapter that covers the spindle cotton picker. [3] Strongly recommend the book for the numerous interesting stories it tells.

Yet both sides continued to deploy massive amounts of conventional ordinances in bombing raids on each other's civilian populations despite this MAD option.

Hence, I’m not convinced that nuclear weapons would prevent conventional hot wars due to the MAD threat. Certainly a US invasion of Russia or China with the stated goal of deposing their leaders would make that risk a high possibility. Yet a hot war in contested territory is an entirely different matter. If 10s of millions of people could be killed in a war that included both megalomaniacs of Hitler and Stalin without anyone resorting to their MAD option then I do believe we could have major armed conflict in conventional times without anyone resorting to nuclear weapons."

Price controls would largely only shift consumer preference from price controlled (i.e., rationed) goods to alternative goods that aren’t yet price controlled and simply change the specific goods experiencing inflation.

I’d also recommend Joseph Politano’s recent article, “Are Rising Corporate Profit Margins Causing Inflation?” [2] (It’s free). That article analyzes corporate profits to show that there isn’t any evidence that our current inflation corresponds to increasing corporate profit margins. E.g., despite higher car prices, car manufacturers have actually had a decrease in profits due to component shortages constraining volume and increased costs.

Politano also points out that the US’s WW2 Office of Price Administration had 160,000 employees at its peak. It would not be feasible for the US to legislate and build a comparably large government org in time to address our current inflation controls. Further, our modern economy is far larger and complicated, with substantial foreign firm integrations.

In this model, the school or another private entity agrees to pay for the students education in return for a percent of the students future earnings above some minimal salary and a fixed max repayment. E.g., BloomTech (formerly Lambda School) is a software engineering bootcamp funded by ISAs.  Their ISA is something like 17% for 24 months once you make at least $50k, capped at a max total payment of $30k.

This gives the educational institute a strong financial incentive to ensure their students succeed professionally. Further, it de-risks the financial obligations for the students. For students with the best outcomes, they’d likely be better off with self-funding, possibly through loans, since they’ll end up paying the maximum amount. Yet all students remove any risk of long term debt obligations. In some ways, this is similar to Substack’s author incentive that guarantees a minimum income, but also minimizes the upside for the most successful.

The federal and state governments could still subsidize education with insufficient financial prospects, but that should be done explicitly and deliberately through grants. This then becomes a political decision about which studies should be subsidized and to what extent do we want to subsidize them. Regardless, no one should face financial ruin because a university scammed them into a financially disastrous education program."

I.e., the better BloomTech does at placing students, the higher the financial value of future ISA sales.

This financing model makes sense to me since BloomTech and other schools need money up front to pay their staff and other operating expenses. The firm’s equity investors don’t want to see their funds used for debt offering, particularly because the company will have to keep selling stock to increase their balance sheet as the program grows in size. Instead, other investors with different financial  goals can provide this funding for a fixed income product (i.e., bond investors). These investors in the ISAs can use the historical financial outcomes of students, along with their beliefs about future economics of the industry to value the ISAs.

To some extent, I believe this is due to increasing political polarization and belief sorting. There’s now a basket of linked beliefs in each political group and there’s strong pressure to accept all of these beliefs in order to be a member of that group. To dissent on a single belief is to attract ingroup attacks from one's compatriots.

I find the merging and climate and anticapitalism beliefs to be particularly dangerous for our long term prospects of combating climate change. Capitalism is simply the dominant socioeconomic order around the globe for all production of any significance. All plausible solutions to climate change will involve capitalist production and profit. E.g., production of solar cells, wind turbines, batteries, and transmission infrastructure. Many investors, entrepreneurs, and executives will collectively make massive wealth gains as we hopefully accelerate the transition to clean energy. We might even see Elon Musk becoming a trillionaire should Tesla play a larger role in these solutions.

Yet there are many climate activists that would find such profiteering on climate solutions ghastly. I fear such activists could even become an impediment to climate change progress as they increasingly attack the firms and individuals producing climate change solutions. While there are certainly good-faith critiques of the current capitalistic order and wealth inequality, those concerns should ideally be separated from climate change. We can tackle capitalism reforms/regulations and redistributive tax policies in separate discussions that address the general problem without linking those issues to climate change.

Unfortunately it wouldn’t surprise me to see these issues increasingly linked in the future. You can see this with the proposed supplement tax credit for EVs produced by union labor. Additional linking in future legislation could greatly impede progress of addressing climate change. Yet for many supposed climate change activists this would be acceptable, possibly even preferable, to an alternative where capitalists profit off accelerated progress of addressing climate change."

Think this is captured in a dictionary definition of the term [1]

> labor that requires special training for its satisfactory performance.

I think this barrier for entry is an important distinction when considering different labor markets. In this context, “unskilled labor” implies that anyone can be hired to perform the job regardless of their previous training/education. All firms and workers compete in a single large “unskilled labor” market. E.g., Amazon and Walmart increasing starting wages can lead to siphoning of employees from other firms in this market or force these firms competing for this labor to raise wages.

In contrast, there is not a single “skilled labor” market, but instead numerous disjoint markets, each requiring different skill sets. At times, the training requirement to enter a specific skilled labor market can benefit workers by limiting supply of workers. Although it is still possible for supply to exceed demand within a specific “skilled labor” market and drives wages down. E.g., the lawyer glut that started appearing in the 90s.

In this context acquiring formal training to enter a specific “skilled labor” market is viewed as an investment of time and money with the aim of increasing earnings. We can analyze the financial returns to an individual for purchasing their own training and incurring the opportunity cost of education versus working. We can also look at government-funded training programs through an economic lens and compute the expected return on investment to society for a specific program.

It can be argued that “skilled” doesn’t necessarily need to refer exclusively to formal training, but can instead also encompass on the job training. E.g., a line cook with years of experience is more productive than someone hired without previous experience. Yet I think it useful to separate “skills” and “experience” and consider them as two orthogonal dimensions. For example, a junior accountant role only requires the formal “skills” of specific education/certification, whereas a senior role additionally requires sufficient on the job experience.

If he appears to be sidelining the progressives, even out of political pragmatism to achieve some of their policy goals, then we could risk voter apathy going forward from progressives. Worse, we could risk a fracturing of the Dem party with the progressive splitting out into their own party. This would ensure Repub victories for the foreseeable future.

In general, I get the impression that both the Dem and Repub leadership are struggling to keep their broad coalitions united. Much of this could be attributed to social media that amplifies the most online and extreme voices. Further, mainstream media commonly bolsters the reach of these extreme positions to moderate compatriots and also ensures that the opposition is well aware of their extremist opponents. The result is an extremely wide overton window and both parties struggle to occupy enough of it to win elections.

Historically, party leadership had much more control over the messaging. So while each party may have still contained some extremists, the extremist views had limited reach. The party could be focused on a strategic portion of the overton window knowing that extremists would naturally gravitate towards the more moderate party on their side. Party leadership chiefly concerned themselves with swing voters who were sympathetic to some issues on each side of the partisan divide."

Much of the programming in 2022 is substantially different than that done in 1960 with much more user friendly languages and tooling. To some extent this started early in the development of software engineering as a profession, notably the 1959 development of the COBOL programming language. It was hailed as a non-technical language for generic business people so that they could encode business rules in computer systems without the need of any technical skills.

Yet as the language and tooling improves we don’t find the candidates changing much. Instead the expectation of software engineers grows. What previously would be done by a team of engineers with a diverse set of technical strengths is now accomplished with a single engineer. That single engineer will leverage modern programming language, open source libraries, and Software-as-a-Service vendors to abstract away all of the deep technical challenges. If anything, we may have accomplished the aim of COBOL with people applying technology without requisite technical depths, yet we still call them software engineers and pay them exorbitant salaries.

As a software engineer, I absolutely expect the expectations of the role to grow and change drastically over the next decade. Yet I’m no longer optimistic that requisite aptitude will be significantly lowered. With the proliferation of cloud computing and SAAS over the last decade, companies have already had the opportunity to keep the role expectation the same, which would allow them to hire lower tier employees.

I will say that tech companies already go to extreme ends to offload any software engineering work that could be handled by someone else or automated. There are a lot of people working tech jobs that while they are not software engineering, they certainly require interacting with technology systems. That will certainly continue as the tech improves, chiefly AI."

Beyond monetary policy, correcting the goods/service spending balance disrupted by the pandemic is in my opinion the best opinion for federal, state, and local governments. Shifting spending away from goods and back to services will lower demand for goods and allow the supply chains some breathing room to recover.

This could introduce some short term inflation in services due services being labor intensive and we currently have a tight labor market.* Yet this will correct the current drivers of inflation in goods and allow the underlying issues in the supply chains to correct themselves. On balance, hopefully the overall change in inflation from the goods/service normalization will be modest.

To this end we need governments at all levels to embrace the pragmatic approaches to covid management as have recently been proposed by numerous liberal thought leaders. E.g., Derek Thompson’s “Vaxxed and Done” proposal. Our leaders should make it clear that vaccinated individuals can basically go on living as normal; only taking precautions when they show symptoms of covid. Further, individuals can leverage testing to determine when to enter and exit self quarantine. Beyond that, people should be encouraged to resume their social habits including consumptions of services such as dining out.

Thankfully goods/services spending partitioning shows some signs of normalization. From Jason Furman’s Twitter thread on Dec spending data. [1]

> Interestingly it was goods that fell in December while service spending rose slight (adjusted for inflation). But overall the economy continues to be tilted towards goods and away from services.

> I'll be looking through this more. Short version: hard to generalize from December given that it is (hopefully) anomalous. Big picture shows some normalization. But the goods-services skew was and is not entirely about the virus, policy likely matters a lot too.

* Note that some services, like newsletters, can absorb consumer spending without requiring more labor. Great time to shill for your favorite substacks and do your part in fighting inflation.

Should Google be barred from displaying all of their info boxes? Should they be legally constrained to just showing links? What if those links happen to include other Google products? E.g., a search for “free email provider” including GMail? Even with no self-preferencing intent, GMail could be the top search result for that query due to organic user preference.

Similarly it’s entirely possible that Yelp isn’t showing high in the search results for a restaurant due to organic user behavior. I personally never trust Yelp reviews after reading about how they extort small businesses with the threat of prominently displaying negative reviews. [1]

> The plaintiff in the suit, a veterinary hospital in Long Beach, CA, is said to have requested that Yelp remove a negative review from the website, which was allegedly refused by the San Francisco startup, after which its sales representatives repeatedly contacted the hospital demanding payments of roughly $300 per month in exchange for hiding or deleting the review.

Additionally, I’m not convinced that separating Google Search from the rest of Alphabet would change much with regard to self-preferencing. The self-preferencing of Google info boxes chould still happen entirely internal to the search company. Yelp and other content aggregators would still have the same grievances about Google using their dominant position to prevent other players from capturing user traffic for numerous types of search queries.

Yes, the breakup would prevent Alphabet from innovating in other directions using revenue from search. Yet I doubt these ventures would struggle to find capital in the current market as demonstrated by Tesla (public markets) and SpaceX (private markets). If anything, investors may prefer the separation so that they can concentrate on the specific parts of Alphabet that they are interested in. Those that are bullish on self-driving can go all in on Waymo whereas those interested in data aggregation and search can invest in Google Search. Investor choice may result in the attraction of even more capital to the separate ventures than currently available to the conglomerate as a whole.

I personally took a similar path, computational chem Ph.D. to tech industry, and I am grateful that I had the option.

The alternatives certainly de-risked the choice of pursuing a highly specialized and esoteric speciality career path; a career path that can be easily crushed with changes in federal funding research priorities. I probably would not have gone to grad school if I wasn’t well aware of the wallstreet alternative career option and am thankful that the explosive growth in the tech industry has opened up additional options.

It is well known that academia produces way more STEM Ph.D.s than can be supported by long term stable career paths. These grad students are the workhorses of research and are essential for making scientific progress. Yet we all know that our prospects of gainful employment as researchers are slim at best. There’s a lot of risk and uncertainty in research and even the brightest and hardest working researchers can find themselves sinking years into research endeavors that yield little of significance.

While I’m excited about the green transition and hate the thought of any pro-fossil fuel policy, we have to admit that this will be a transition and any rapid increase in the price of energy (particularly gasoline) will lead to a voter revolt. Hence we need a broad domestic energy policy towards the aim of economic stability and national security that includes stable fossil fuel prices.

One idea I’ve seen thrown around is having the government make loans to oil and gas firms for increasing production and processing capacity. Firms and their investors are currently skittish about aggressive investments due to the shale boom and bust of the mid 2010s. To protect them against collapsing fossil fuel prices the loans will include novel repayment credits. For example, any barrel of oil sold below $x will generate a credit equal to the difference between $x and the price, where x is something like $60/barrel. Therefore if fossil fuel prices collapse due to our massive investment then this will be a direct subsidy. Whereas if prices stay high then the government gets the loans paid back in full.

Again, I don’t like the idea of promoting fossil fuel production. Yet I recognize that we Democrats need a holistic energy policy that includes stable gasoline prices if we want to shepherd the US through the green transition. Otherwise voters will elect another oil man like GWB who may attempt to make the US into another petrostate."

Yet, if there are significant innate genetic components impacting career success in our advanced economy then some people will be inherently disadvantaged in following this path. Further, education and other interventions may not be able to close this gap. In that case we may want to downplay educational expansion as a means to addressing poverty and instead propose more redistribution to directly improve people’s material conditions.

Additionally, do you think KPH’s strong moral argument for society/government to ensure everyone lives a life of dignity without material deprivation due the inherent unfairness of the genetic lottery is productive?

At times donors themselves may care more about supporting ideological purist movements that reinforce the donor’s personal identity than a boring pragmatic cause.

Hence, activists can be incentivized to create the most compelling ideological product to sell to donors. Further, they need to differentiate themselves from competing activism products by developing a unique brand. And of course they want to maximize their courting of free media coverage, including distribution on social media. That can incentivize taking extreme and outrageous positions that are more likely to garner engagement.

One needn’t even assume activist leadership is deliberately scheming to craft optimal ideological products for sale to donors. Market forces alone could ensure that more compelling and engaging movements outcompete lesser ones and thereby garner more funds for continuation and expansion.

The rich already spend a disproportionately small portion of their income on consumption; the majority of their income is saved and invested. Increasing taxes may have some impact on their marginal consumption, but they could also just slightly decrease their savings rate. And if we continue to define rich as income in excess of $400k then we are only addressing a vanishingly small amount of consumption.

Decreasing the savings and investment rate of the rich will aid in slowly decreasing inflation. With less investment in the economy fewer new businesses will be created and thereby fewer new jobs. Similarly, existing businesses will be less able to raise capital to expand operations. Distressed businesses will find themselves unable to restructure their debt with new financing and will instead need to minimize their operations or possibly go out of business. All of this will slow the growth of the economy and loosen up the labor market. Note these mechanisms are the same ones impacted by raising interest rates and increasing the cost of capital."

[1] His basic idea is to separate Twitter into a backend service that hosts content and a front end client that provides moderation and algorithmic amplification. Twitter would then open the backend up so that anyone can develop their own client by paying for access.

The backend would do the minimal amount of moderation necessary to conform with the law in each jurisdiction and then provide optional services to the clients for more sophisticated moderation and algorithmic ranking. Twitter would continue to host their existing front end and possibly create more over time.

The idea is that the plethora of clients would allow for experimentation and meeting the diverse user preferences. You could have heavily moderated clients as well as wild west anything goes. While all clients would reference the same social graph and tweets/replies, each client could use whatever methods they want for filtering and ranking.

Some possible clients I’ve considered.

1. A client geared towards journalists and other prominent people that provides them with a layer that filters out harassment. This could include manual curation of their DMs, replies and retweets. The service would also have a team of lawyers for reporting credible threats of violence to law enforcement and sending cease-and-desist letters for proper libel. (Note this works well with Elon’s plan to require human identity verification, even for anonymous accounts.) This service would be expensive and geared towards people that value this layer of protection for professional reasons.

2. A client geared towards techies like myself that want to experiment with their own algorithms. While we’re a niche group, many of us would gladly pay quite a bit of money to support such a nerdy hobby. There’d be sharing and critique of each other's work as we toil to optimize our own Twitter experience. Over time some of the ideas might filter into other clients' algorithms.

3. Partisan clients. Fox news could provide a client as could CNN. Even the DNC, RNC, and other parties could provide their preferred view of the social graph. They’d be openly filtering and ranking the social feed in a way that corresponds to the user's political preference.

On a related tangent, I think everyone should also act as if everything they say online can and will be tied to their public real identity. The OPSEC necessary to ensure an anonymous account can never be tied to ones real identity is higher than most people realize. Just one sloppy mistake can deanonymize an account. For many people this could be something as basic as forgetting which account they are on saying something that provides a connection.

Hence, I recommend everyone always use their real name so they're not tempted to say something that would embarrass them should it be tied back to their real identity."

Many of them failed, largely IMO because they didn't invest enough in foreign talent and management, including training them in business specific needs. They also optimized for the lowest labor cost rather than finding the appropriate balance between cost and value delivered. The foreign teams were set up to fail because execs wanted to show a quick improvement in financials.

Many big tech companies today already have some physical presence in lower wage nations and do benefit from the lower labor costs. [1] Yet, there is significant overhead to running these offices and additional costs for coordination. Further, there is a limited quantity of talent in low-wage nations and many of the most ambitious and capable workers aim to immigrate to a high-wage nation. These firms could already have chosen to accelerate growth of their campuses in foreign markets if they saw a significant opportunity for labor cost savings.

Remote work may certainly improve the economics of employing foreign labor, but I fear some firms may fail at this because they will again prioritize lower cost and quick ROI too heavily. Remote work has unique costs and challenges, and overseas WFH will have additional ones (e.g., timezone and language differences). Firms will need to make significant investments in remote work processes — particularly onboarding and ongoing mentorship — if their endeavors are to succeed.

Two paragraphs in particular worth highlighting

> The fundamentals of low supply of houses, low mortgage rates, and the entry of millions of millennials into the housing market armed with higher personal savings help explain most of why the housing market has careened out of control over the past year. According to the National Rental Home Council, a single-family home rental lobbying group, “single-family rental home companies accounted for less than 0.14 percent of homes purchased” and just 0.09 percent of net homes if you count the fact that many single-family rental investors sold homes as well.

> The role of institutional investors is still being studied, but the popularity of the narrative strikes at something dangerous: People want a convenient boogeyman and when they get it, they often ignore the structural problems that are harder to combat. Housing undersupply is the result of decades of locals opposing new home building. It’s not something that can be blamed on Wall Street greed and the nefarious tinkering of a private equity firm. And that’s a much harder truth to stomach.

And there's also the Derek Thompson's Jun 2021 article, ""BlackRock Is Not Ruining the U.S. Housing Market"", https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/blackrock-ruining-us-housing-market/619224/

> The U.S. has roughly 140 million housing units, a broad category that includes mansions, tiny townhouses, and apartments of all sizes. Of those 140 million units, about 80 million are stand-alone single-family homes. Of those 80 million, about 15 million are rental properties. Of those 15 million single-family rentals, institutional investors own about 300,000; most of the rest are owned by individual landlords. Of that 300,000, the real-estate rental company Invitation Homes—in which BlackRock is an investor—owns about 80,000.

I would also recommend Haidt's Feb 2016 Vox article, ""Donald Trump supporters think about morality differently than other voters. Here’s how.""

This means that Trump supporters are more centrist than is commonly realized; consequently, Trump's prospects in the general election may be better than many pundits have thought. Cruz meanwhile, with a further-right moral profile, may have more difficulty attracting centrist Democrats and independents than would Trump.

The activists pushing for the language changes appear to be more interested in advancing their own status within the progressive wing rather than achieving progressive outcomes. They want to develop and own the most avant-garde language so that they can write and speak on the topic, and ultimately take on more leadership. To me it looks like pure and simple careerism.

Another major issue is insufficient refinery capacity to convert crude oil into refined products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. As a result, these refined products are trading at much higher prices than would be expected from current crude prices. Javier Blas covered this issue in his May 9th article, “Sorry, But for You, Oil Trades at $250 a Barrel”. [1]

> If you are the owner of an oil refinery, then crude is trading happily just a little above $110 a barrel — expensive, but not extortionate. If you aren’t an oil baron, I have bad news: it's as if oil is trading somewhere between $150 and $275 a barrel.

> From 1985 to 2021, the crack spread averaged about $10.50 a barrel. Even between 2004 and 2008, during the so-called golden age of refining, the crack spread never surpassed $30. It rarely spent more than a few weeks above $20. Last week, however, the margin jumped to a record high of nearly $55. Crack margins for diesel and other petroleum products surged much higher. 

> Third, and perhaps most importantly, refining capacity has declined where it matters for the market now, and the plants that are operating are struggling to process enough crude to satisfy the demand for fuel. Martijn Rats, an oil analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that outside China and the Middle East, oil distillation capacity fell by 1.9 million barrels a day from the end of 2019 to today — that’s the largest decline in 30 years.

> The downward trend started well before the pandemic hit, as old Western refineries struggled to compete, environmental regulations increased costs and the unfounded fear of peak oil demand amid the energy transition prompted some companies to close plants. The fuel-demand collapse triggered by Covid-19 only turbo-charged the trend, resulting in dozens of refinery operations shutting down for good in Europe and the U.S. in 2020 and 2021.

It’s obscene that we continue to enable these predatory programs by sadling their students with unserviceable levels of debt through federally-subsidized student loans.

I understand our coalition concerns about aggrieving higher education professionals, but I don’t think we can continue to ignore this problem. We need to work with them to reform their programs so that they are economically sound. We’d need to do this even if we replaced student loans with direct subsidies so as to not squander taxpayer funds.

I’ve seen several analyses over the years about the extent to which the gainful employment test would exclude financially-exploitative non-profit programs. A quick search for up-to-date stats turned up this 2020 article, “Many Nonprofit College Programs Would Fail Gainful Test”. [1]

> Only about 60 percent of programs at private nonprofit institutions, and 70 percent of those at public colleges and universities, would pass the Obama administration’s gainful-employment test, if it were in place and applied to them, according to an online tool developed by a conservative Texas policy group.

> Only 5,646 of 10,147, or 55.6 percent, of private, for-profit programs for which income and debt data were available would have passed the standard. Another 2,071, or a fifth, would have failed. And 2,430, or 24 percent, of the programs would have been on probation.

> But private nonprofits didn’t do much better. Only 6,262 of 10,585 programs, or 59 percent, would have passed. Another 1,916, or 18 percent, would have failed. And 2,407, or 22.7 percent, would have been on probation.

> This indicates that a lot of the people asserting that for-profits are uniquely bad actors are wrong -- as a group, their performance is quite similar to that of nonprofits. Publics do noticeably better than either nonprofit private or for-profit colleges, no doubt because they generally cost less to attend and therefore their graduates have less debt.

In San Francisco for example, I found that new development was opposed on the grounds that it would displace existing low income residents with rich techies while enriching corporate developers. Not to mention an absolute aversion to anything remotely capitalistic. E.g., supply and demand arguments for decreasing rents would be flat out rejected as “neoliberalism”.

At times I wonder if these arguments could be reversed to paint NIMBYism as a form of crony capitalism. We could speculate that the biggest and most politically connected corporate developers are leveraging their power to monopolize the local market by owning the zoning process. This allows them to drive out small developers that would otherwise be building more units and thereby providing the additional housing that our community desperately needs. These big corporate developers could even be financing astroturf campaigns that disguise their political stooges as champions of social justice so that they can continue to control the zoning process on behalf of their corporate overlords."

The issue is that US farming has pivoted away from wheat and to corn and soybeans. The shift to corn is particularly concerning as the increased crop is primarily used for dubious ethanol production to use in fuel. And the growth in soybean planting is all about exporting animal feed for Chinese pig farmers.

> Longer-term, the U.S. is the natural candidate to fill in for Russia’s missing wheat surplus. American farmers spent the past several decades replacing wheat fields with corn and soybeans. The area harvested for wheat in the U.S. has shrunk by more than 40% since 1997 (from 25.4 million hectares to 15 million hectares), while land harvested for corn is up by 17.5% (from 29.4 million hectares to 34.6 million hectares) and land harvested for soybeans is up by 25% (from 28 million hectares to 35 million hectares).

> If U.S. wheat acreage had remained constant and productivity had followed the same upward path, U.S. farmers would be harvesting about 32 additional megatons of wheat each year right now. That would be roughly enough to offset the loss of Russian exports. The transition might take a few years, but it should be achievable using the full array of tools present in the typical U.S. farm bill.

His basic thesis is that out-of-school factors dominate (accepted by Yglesias [1]) and almost no education interventions are found to have long term effects on student performance and life outcomes. 

I believe this is best summarized in deBoer’s article “Education Doesn't Work”, https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/education-doesnt-work?s=r

> This point is both totally banal and yet potentially revelatory given our educational policy conversations: mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. Students sort themselves into an ability hierarchy at a very early age and tend to stay in their position in that hierarchy for the remainder of their lives, to a remarkable degree. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling.

>  Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded with economic gain by our society.

> The persistence of relative academic performance is remarkable. Standardized test scores collected at the age of thirteen are strong predictors of not just future high school and college educational performance but adult outcomes like academic career milestones and economic position, even after adjusting for parental income.

I’ve never been particularly comfortable with this critique and its implications. Yet I think it is important when we put so much focus on K-12 education as a means of improving society, including decreasing social inequalities. deBoer’s critique suggests we should decrease the emphasis on education and focus more on income redistribution.

I particularly appreciate how Alexander explains New Atheists as evolving out of these earlier long-form discussions and eassys.

> The atheists of Early Internet Argument Culture were not New Atheists. The term “New Atheism” didn’t really catch on until about 2006 when Richard Dawkins published The God Delusion; Early Internet Argument Culture was just a prelude to the main event. Post-2006 atheists were brasher and more political. They were less interested in arguing with religious people about the minutiae of carbon-dating; they were more interested in posting about how stupid carbon-dating denalists were, on their own social media feeds, read entirely by other atheists. The concept of the Internet as magical place where you could change other people’s minds had given way to the Internet as magical place where you could complain to like-minded friends about how ignorant other people were.

I’m a little ashamed to admit that I contributed to the barrage of online atheism writing as an edgy atheist teenager circa 2000. I think many of us enjoyed belonging to what felt like a rebellious community with “secret” knowledge of how religion influenced the world. Rather ironically, I imagine this is similar to the experience that draws people to cults. I believe that our long-form writing served as a religious rite that helped us feel closer to the atheist community and more deeply committed to the beliefs."

I could see Republicans putting forth a budget, through a reconciliation bill, that is unacceptable to Biden and other Democrats. He could rightfully veto that and then we’d find ourselves in a comparable crisis. In the Clinton case, he managed to secure enough public support so that Gingrich eventually backed down and accepted Clinton’s proposed budget.

I don’t really get Yarvin’s focus on bureaucrats when right wing populist seem to be having more success focusing on the mainstream media and tech industry.

My particular concern for the Democrats is that our elites’ disproportionate amount of power is particularly visible. In contrast, Republic elites (e.g., Koch, Cato, Manhattan Institute) are only known to political junkies. Further, our progressive elites—particularly in journalism and academia—are engaged in an intra-elite competition to see who can be the most pious progressive by developing and championing ever-more-extreme views. I worry that our highly visible elites will grow increasingly distant from the median Democratic voter (let alone the median voter in general) and this will be exploited by right wingers to pull away voters and possibly risk fracturing our broad coalition."

I just think that there is too much uncertainty and downside risk as we transition to green energy.

Afterall, how many of us would be willing to invest a non-trivial portion of our networth into a new domestic fossil fuel project that doesn’t plan to start generating cash for 2 to 10 years? Putting aside the morality concerns around investing in fossil fuels (a la ESG investing), does it look like a lucrative bet? What is the risk we end up in another oil boom and best similar to the 2015 shale financial implosion? Could OPEC+ choose to increase production to again strangle out the US oil industry? What does the regulatory future look like? To what extent will green energy get increasingly cheaper and crowd out fossil fuels even without government action?.

I personally can’t see domestic fossil fuels being a good investment without some massive changes in market factors. We could implement Yglesias’s idea for decreasing oil volatility by massively expanding the strategic petroleum reserve to soak up domestic oil when it’s cheap and sell it into the market when it gets expensive. [1] But I just don’t think the political calculus will work out.

Climate activists will be outraged by this plan to encourage more domestic fossil fuel production through what is essentially an industrial subsidy. Voters may like the idea in theory, but right wing populists will criticize the plan to artificially raise the price of oil when supply is abundant. They’ll call it a backdoor carbon tax, which is not inaccurate. Worse of all, if the US government introduces a mechanism to control the price of oil then there will be political pressure to keep the price low. Now that the president actually has a lever to control the price of gasoline they’ll always be compelled to shift the prices lower.

Afterall, why add a tax just so that we can send the money back to the taxpayer?

And there still are distributional issues beyond the regressive tax. Many people living in rural areas that rely on a lot of driving will be paying more in carbon taxes than they receive in dividends. Conversely, city dwellers that take public transit will get more in dividends than they pay through carbon taxes. Yes, that is what we want to encourage less consumption of fossil fuels.

Instead, they’re primary focus is on fundraising and volunteer recruiting. At times their best marketing strategy is to sell the argument for increasing prices by strangeling out domestic supply. At other times that argument is less palatable. This is no different from car manufacturers highlighting their fuel efficiency when gasoline prices are high and shifting to marketing other features when consumers aren’t focused on prices of gasoline.

At the end of the day, we need to accept that activists of all stripes are first and foremost focused on fundraising. I actually think there is a productive line of attack against counterproductive lefits NGOs based around this truth. Rather than attacking supply-side climate activists for their poor approach to limiting emissions, we should instead praise them for their innovative and effective marketing campaign. We should compare and contrast their marketing strategies through a capitalistic lens no different than how McKinsey would critique Coke’s branding.

Building off yesterday's post, “The case against restricting domestic fossil fuel supply”, I think we Democrats need to recognize that an adversarial stance towards the domestic oil and gas industry is a poor approach to addressing climate change. While we should remain committed to the green transition, we should be clear that this is a transition and during this process we need stable energy prices. And we should prefer domestic fossil fuel extraction and refining satisfies a substantial share of the global demand because we can minimize their environmental harm beyond carbon emissions through stringent regulation that is not practiced in other countries.

While vilifying oil and gas companies may please certain climate activists, this is a counterproductive approach towards achieving the green transition and further it alienates voters who are being financially squeezed by high and volatile energy prices. We instead need some sort of holistic energy plan that combines policies for accelerating the green transition with healthy respect for a robust domestic oil and gas industry that is necessary throughout this transition."

Afterall, why are we giving them back their money if they are the bad guys in this story? And an extra tax sounds like a pretty weak penalty for the crooks that are robbing the American consumer through outrageous gasoline prices. I just don’t think this will resonate with voters.

If we really wanna go with the greedflation narrative then we should properly commit to it. We should annonce an FTC investigation into collusion between oil and gas producers to curtail supply and therefore control prices. We should say that the general lack of investment into these highly lucrative industries is circumstantial evidence of illegal behavior and warrants a proper federal investigation. We could easily find at least one large investor that is a shareholder in two or more oil companies and suggest that they are illegally coordinating action between independent firms."

By instead owning the issue he’ll capture voter attention and demonstrate leadership to addressing American voters’ biggest issue. For example, what if Biden said the following:

> Today I admit that I failed to address inflation issues and as a result Americans are being financially squeezed by higher and higher prices. I was too quick to accept the narrative that these price increases were transitory and would soon abate. That was a comforting narrative that allowed us to avoid addressing the issue head on while we continued to focus on defeating Covid. I now recognize that inflation is not going away on its own and I will make it my top priority to do everything within my power to stabilize prices for all Americans.

> Further, I didn’t properly fortify the US economy against global disruptions. In hindsight it is all too obvious that Putin's deranged leadership of Russia presented a massive liability to the global market for such essential commodities as oil, natural gas, wheat, and numerous metals. I should’ve made it a priority to grow and strengthen US industry in these areas so that we would be prepared to meet shortfalls should Putin choose to remove Russia from the free world and exit these markets.

> Putin has subsequently made that choice with devastating consequences throughout the world, including painfully higher prices for all Americans. I should’ve properly identified that risk even before entering the Whitehouse and prepared the appropriate domestic industrial policy to grow American productive output in these key industries. I have now directed my team to prepare such policy and it will be a top priority to strengthen our industries so that United States can replace Russia’s output and stabilize prices."

Opposition need not directly state their visceral dislike to living among the downtrodden that would reside in the new SROs. Instead, they can oppose it on numerous other grounds. E.g., the limited accommodations of an SRO are inhumane, private ownership of SROs would lead to capitalistic exploitation of societies most vulnerable, SROs operators would ruthlessly turn away anyone with mental health or drug addiction issues.

One idea is to argue for both public and private SROs simultaneously. The publicly owned and operated SROs would address anticapitalism and discrimination concerns. And they offer more accomidnations than shelters while being cheaper than providing full apartments. Once public SROs are begrudgingly accepted, then private SROs can be defended as providing accommodations for the less downtrodden that would like to spend less of their limited paycheck on housing."

Further, they’ll still need to panhandler or steal to continue to make ends meet; particularly funding their drug use. And that is the behavior that everyone wants to see addressed.

I believe that any plan to address homelessness needs to make a clear differentiation between these two different groups of people since the socially disruptive group is the one that most residents have in mind when discussing homelessness. SROs can certainly help the people that are just downtrodden and need a cheap place to live. The individuals with severe mental health or addiction issues need another plan. A plan that likely involves coercion into treatment and in some cases institutionalization. I think making a strong distinction between the two populations of homeless individuals will be helpful in pushing for zoning changes that help the individuals that are just downtrodden."

As identified in the article, the chief bottleneck is refining capacity and that takes years to increase. We may be able to address this issue by 2024 to improve Democrats' election odds, but even that will require a major pivot on climate policy and messaging if we want an expansion of our domestic oil and gas industry.

And I think that would be a generally smart move politically and can be accomplished in a way that doesn’t harm our progress on the green transition. Yglesias explained this well in last week’s article, “The case against restricting domestic fossil fuel supply”. [1] Basically, fighting the domestic O&G industry is essentially a “shadow carbon tax”, with the “tax” captured by foreign O&G producers (e.g., Russia and Saudi Arabia). Further, rather than predictably increasing over time—as a carbon tax should so that consumers can plan to transition away—we instead get volatile prices that just financially harm Americans. That anti-domestic O&G industry policy and messaging could even be counterproductive if voters come to associate Democrats as the cause of the high and volatile energy prices.

Instead, we should focus on accelerating the green transition while having a healthy respect for a domestic O&G industry throughout the transition; a transition that will take over a decade. That would include messaging and policy that promotes our domestic O&G industry. For example, Yglesias has proposed decreasing the volatility of oil prices by massively expanding the strategic petroleum reserve to soak up domestic oil when it’s cheap (possibly guaranteeing a price floor for the domestic market) and sell it into the market when it gets expensive. [2] Such a shift in messaging and policy should generally encourage private investment in the domestic O&G industry as skittish investors get reassured that their investments will not be regulated out of existence in the near future.

Oil and refined products are sold in a competitive market and individual producers cannot artificially decrease the price. Even a cartel of producers mandating a lower price would simply lead to shortages as the demand at that lower price exceeds supply. The only thing worse than having to buy expensive gasoline is not being able to buy it at all.

While I’m certain poor strategy and tactics towards addressing diversity and representation goals is a source of issues, I get the impression that there are additional sources. E.g., the coalition-brain problem in which every left-leaning organization feels compelled to incorporate all other liberal/progressive causes into its mission, which can give rise to that ACLU tweet in which pro-choice activism needs to incporporate LGBT+ advocacy.

In thinking through a more general understanding of the challenges of these institutions, I immediately recalled FrigidWind’s comment from Friday’s mailbox that also addressed these issues. [1]

> I think that Matt is either blind or papering over an important part in what makes leftist organizations so vulnerable to the phenomenon described in the Grim article: the types of people who work there. They tend to be low conscientiousness (remember how they said the best way to honor George Floyd was to...loosen deadlines?), high neuroticism and high openness (which is why they follow dumb fads). This is what I call ""protest disorder"" or the ""protestor personality"". Building an organization out of these types is like trying to build using jello bricks. This is why I keep saying that the best organizations are the ones that attract normies.

There is some harsh truth in that statement which has captivated my thinking on the issues plaguing progressive activists institutes. And that explanation seems to address some of the common themes of the Ryan Grim article; just numerous cases where the mission of an activist group was derailed by counterproductive and divisive diversions.

In any other organization, I would expect coworkers to pull the focus back to the work at hand. If necessary, I’d expect managers to intervene to explicitly tell someone to get back on task. Yet that may not be possible when a team is disproportionately composed of people with personality traits that make them susceptible to these diversions. Coworkers would not be nudging each other back on task but instead fanning the flames of obstruction. Managers too may even feel compelled to put work aside when such a distraction arises.

E.g., the Italy-Germany 10 year bond spread is currently around 2.2%, which is already a substantial rise from the ~1% spread seen throughout the pandemic. [1]

ECB President Christine Lagarde announced an intention to control this spread using some new, yet to be developed, tool. Bloomberg has a good overview on how this could work. [2]

> The European Central Bank has sought to stave off the danger of a sovereign-debt storm with the promise of a new tool to curb market stress after Italian bond yields breached 4% on June 14, the highest since the market turmoil of 2014. Investors are viewing the renewed push to tackle so-called fragmentation as evidence policy makers will fight to prevent borrowing costs in the union from diverging excessively. That’s a dynamic that threatened to rip the euro-zone apart during the crisis a decade ago.

The risk is that other countries, chiefly Germany, may disapprove of this plan since it appears that the ECB will be monetizing Italian debt at the expense of addressing the eurozone's inflationary problems. This potential conflict would be similar to the 2010’s European debt crisis, [3] where southern states, particularly Greece, needed monetary intervention or debt restructuring and northern states like Germany opposed such measures and dragged their feet until it looked like the eurozone was gonna disintegrate.

We can even explain some of the neural and hormonal processes associated with those experiences and show they are highly similar to that which occurs in human biology. That leads us to care about animal treatment and no similar biological analogy exists for AI systems.

Sentience is also a consideration in human concerns like the abortion rights debate and end-of-life care. Ezra explored some of these challenges in a recent podcast episode with law professor Kate Greasley, who has extensively studied and written on the legal and moral philosophy of abortion.

E.g., create an argument in support of Trump’s attempt to steal the election for Warren voters from a financial regulation and climate change perspective.

Obviously such a ridiculous example would just serve as a creative writing prompt for a human writer. And the results would likely be humorous at best and most certainly not convincing to the intended audience. But an AI system could have a much deeper understanding of the written arguments that are convincing to the target group and how the concepts of those arguments could connect to the target prompt. The AI system could develop an understanding of the audience’s psychology that exceeds any human researcher’s ability and discover subtle writing tricks that tap into the target’s subconscious response to text.

That doesn’t guarantee that AI could actually convince Warren voters to support Trump’s insurrection. But it could likely do far better than any human writer could hope to do. And many other audiences might be more easily convinced with writing engineered to tap deeply into their psyche.

Imagine the impact of political messaging teams armed with such an AI system that could engineer the most electorally-efficient platform for their candidate and personalize it down to the individual level based upon each reader’s social media consumption. Individuals could even converse directly with the AI to learn more about the candidate’s platform and in the process be efficiently converted to true believers.

60336780,Housing inflation is higher than the Fed thinks — but already falling,https://www.slowboring.com/p/housing-inflation-is-higher-than,7303402,Matt Hagy,3094604,2022-06-23 07:08:28-04:00,7,0,1,,,7303402,1,,,"The Federal Open Market Committee—the group that determines monetary policy—does forecast inflation among other economic predictions to guide their policy. That includes estimating future rent contributions to PCE using data such as market rents. For example, here’s the conclusions from a Feb 2022 letter from the SF Fed predicting higher inflation through sustained increases in the rental component due to higher market rents. [1]

> As the U.S. economy recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, some increase in rent inflation should be expected, given that landlords can ask for higher rents when prospective tenants are employed and earning higher incomes. However, the extraordinarily large increases in two leading indicators of future rent inflation—asking rent inflation and house price inflation—point to significant upside risks to the overall inflation outlook. The potential increases are particularly significant for CPI inflation, which places a larger weight on shelter costs. Still, the potential additions to PCE inflation of about 0.5pp for both 2022 and 2023 are important to consider in light of the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target.

So the Fed is to some extent considering how current market rents will impact future inflation and using that consideration in developing monetary policy. It could be argued that the FOMC members are not putting sufficient weight on this specific consideration. Additionally, their forecasts may incorrectly estimate the future inflation contribution of rents and misguide policy. For example, in May 2022 the Richmond Fed revisited Aug 2021 predictions about future inflationary contributions of rents made by the Dallas Fed and found the predictions significantly underestimated inflation. [2]

> Growth in the PCE rent index exceeded 4 percent year over year in March, a threshold that the model predicted would not be crossed until the second quarter of 2023. Similarly, imputed rent for homeowners rose 4.4 percent in March, which the model predicted would have been attained in the first quarter of 2023. Year-over-year growth in both rent and imputed rent was over 1.5 percentage points higher than the upper confidence interval of the forecast in March.

It may simply be that during periods of high economic volatility it is hard to estimate the future trajectory of inflation. Any predictive model developed on historical data may simply fail to extrapolate to the specific novel economic forces that cause the volatility.

In retrospect it’s easy to say that the Fed should’ve better extrapolated how surging market rents in 2021 would lead to sustained inflation as leases rolled over. But had the sudden surge been followed by a comparable collapse in rents then such predictions would also have looked foolish. The core problem may be the inability to predict the evolution of our economy during periods of high volatility.

Hence a profitable company with no debt likely has a non-optimal capital structure from a tax perspective, where capital structure refers to financing via debt (bonds) vs equity (stock). There may be a good justification for why interest should be a pre-tax expense in at least some cases, but the result is that corporate accountants will be failing shareholders if they don't find the optimal level of debt for a given corp's cash flow.

That can involve issuing bonds even when there is no need for the cash. And when a corp has cash that it cannot productively spend then it should return the cash to shareholders via either dividends or share buybacks. It may never make sense to use post-tax earnings to pay down the principal and the corp will keep rolling over its bonds despite being able to pay down the debt. Because, again, there is some optimal level of debt for the corp to hold.

There’s certainly more nuance here than I understand since I have a very amateur understanding of corp finance.

Rather than clarify party priorities to voters we’d instead just end up reinforcing the “Dems in disarray” narrative.

We ended up in our grab bag, collision-brain situation because everyone is focused on their own pet issues and will not relent to any common consus. Further, as Yglesias has said numerous times, we all more-or-less agree about the dangers of Republican electoral victories, but many progressive activists reject the idea that moderation is the route to defeating the Republicans at the polls.

And I think the key reason for that is that electoral defeats don’t harm the loudest activists. Even victories rarely provide any tangible prize that changes their day-to-day lives. (The exception of course being student loan forgiveness.) In contrast, the civil rights movement for racial justice and subsequent causes such as women’s equality and gay rights were led and staffed by direct stakeholders. Success gave immediate improvements in these individuals' lives and defeat meant the continuation of the unjust status quo or possibly even regression of early progress.

In fact there is only a single brief mention of this issue:

> I intentionally didn’t include a lot of economic policies on this list. … Inflation, which I realize is a huge problem, poses a different kind of challenge. There is little evidence Democrats know how to address it, and even less that voters trust them on the issue.

Great! We’re admitting defeat on the number one issue on voter’s minds. We might as well forgo spending time, money, and effort on the midterms and just save all of that for 2024; hoping that inflation is no longer an issue.

Any serious plan for the 2022 midterms needs put inflation front and center. I guess the Biden administration’s inadequate attention and lack of a serious plan for inflation is leading others away from this focus. But we cannot secede this territory to the Republicans. We can’t let Republicans continue to reinforce the false narrative that they offer better economic policy.

We need to embrace something like Skanda Amarnath’s plan to rapidly expand the supply of key commodities, chiefly energy. [1] We need to let Americans know that we Democrats have a serious plan to address our urgent inflation challenges and are well executing that plan.

* Each point corresponds to progressive policy
* For every policy, there is one point for each group showing the popularity for that policy within that group
* The y-axis shows how popular that policy is within that group
* The x-axis shows the overall popularity of the policy across all groups. Hence, all points for the same policy across groups have the same value on the x-axis.

For example, the group of left-most points around 37% on the x-axis all correspond to a single progressive policy that is generally unpopular and the y-axis shows how the popularity of that policy varies across self-identified groups. For that policy, there is a ton of variance with ~10% of “Conservatives over 34” supporting it and ~70% support for “Liberals under 35”.

The roughly positive correlation between x and y for each group (i.e., that there is a trend right and up) shows that generally popular policies are also more popular within each group. The vertical distance between different groups demonstrates that self identification is generally meaningful; across all progressive policies there is generally a difference in how popular that policy is across self identified groups.

And further they might be particularly amenable to liberal/progressive policies with the right marketing. They could possibly even shift some of their views towards a more consistent moderate political worldview if they can be sold on some progressive policies.

I'm personally quite interested in better understanding the views of this group. Partially to convert them, but also just general curiosity about what makes this group tick. Does religion play a key role? What about opposition to SJWs/political correctness/wokeness? How strongly do they buy into right wing economics (e.g., Reaganism)?

[1] As Yglesias discussed in that article, not only is there no evidence that this works in persuading voters towards a moderate version of the position, there is ample evidence that there is a backlash from the opposition that has an anti-persuasion effect. E.g., Trump’s extreme positions against immigration didn’t lead to Independents or Democrats accepting more moderate immigration limitations. Quite the opposite, they became more supportive of immigration. Similarly, “Defund the Police” didn’t lead to more support for moderate police reform; it just made any talk about police reform politically toxic.

And for a binary question like support/oppose, we can compute the error bars for different sample sizes fairly easily using a straightforward formula. [1]

standard error = z * sqrt(p * (1-p) / n)

where:
* z: probit, which depends on level of confidence. [2] for the common 95% confidence, z=1.96
* p: proportion support (or oppose since it’s symmetric)
* n: the number of samples

The estimated error goes to zero if p is 0% (or 100%) and is maximized at p=50%. For p=50%, the error bars encompassing 95% confidence levels are as follows for different n values.

* n=10: 31%
* 25: 20%
* 100: 9.8%
* 1000: 3.1%

E.g., for n=100 and p=50%, we’d expect repeated trials of this survey with different respondents to have a p between ~40% and~ 60%, 95% of the time.

For p=25% (or 75%):
* 10: 26%
* 25: 17%
* 100: 8.5%
* 1000: 2.7%

Couldn’t find anywhere where Shor specified sample size, but if it is at least 100 respondents per a data point then the confidence interval cannot exceed 10% for any of the points. I would generally trust Shor to only use and report survey data with sufficient predictive power since he’s such a stickler for methods.

For one, this analysis doesn’t consider the sentiment expressed about the topic. E.g., the negative coefficient on “cis” could be largely due to opponents of using that term arguing against it within their comments and such comments being penalized with fewer likes.

I mainly think of this analysis as just being a curiosity about how an extremely simple model identifies terms that are correlated with the number of likes on a comment. The model itself is incredibly inaccurate at predicting the number of likes that a given comment will receive based upon the comments text as it fails to capture any nuance about the message communicated by the text."

(Maybe even use the Twitter option “Not interested in this Tweet” / “This Tweet isn’t relevant” so that Twitter algorithms learn to down-rank similar tweets.) We should avoid intra-coalition infighting as well as minimize the salience of our less effective messaging.

Instead, our ire and frustration should be directed at the extremist on the anti-abortion side. We should raise the salience of their most extreme and counterproductive messaging. We should force the anti-abortion side to fight within their coalition, with their supporters of more moderate restrictions having to defend cases where they believe abortion should be allowed. E.g., in cases where both the mother’s life is at risk and the fetus is non-viable.

Any engagement will just enhance the reach of the counterproductive SM post and encourage further suboptimal posting from our interlocutor.

We obviously can’t prevent people in our coalitions from picking fights on SM with other members of our team over policy and messaging disagreements. But we can avoid amplifying that disagreement, which includes limiting the reach of the posts that we find counterproductive.

That doesn’t mean we can’t critique policy and messaging; we just shouldn’t do it on SM. Instead, articles, podcasts, and other longer form mediums can be used to compare and contrast different approaches as that longer form allows for exploration of nuances as well as gives us the space to demonstrate respect to our compatriots ideas that we simply disagree with.

Rather than using 280 characters to provide a sharp criticism of our compatriots, we can write paragraphs in which we empathize with their views, celebrate our common goals, and offer a nuanced comparison of approaches towards our shared goals.

The main effect will be withdrawing credit products from the riskiest borrowers. E.g., young people without any credit history, people who’ve defaulted on payments and have lower credit scores, etc. 

That may be a good thing as these consumers can just switch to using debit products to (re)build their credit history. I also think there is an argument that consumers who can only borrow at exorbitant rates should be denied credit rather than taking on the burdensome interest payments. But we should be explicit about this being our desired goal rather than pretending that no one will be denied credit and will instead just get to pay less in interest.

Also, if we’re going to be revising credit card regulation, then I think we should also look into capping interchange rates. These are the costs charged by the issuing bank to the merchant and can commonly be as high as 2% of the transaction total. These fees are passed on to the consumer by being baked into the purchase prices of all goods and services. Further, card networks prevent merchants from charging different prices for credit cards vs. debit cards or cash. And therefore all consumers subsidize credit card usage. The EU has such a cap at 0.3%. [1]

Of course this is how credit cards are able to offer such generous rewards programs and lure in consumers. But it seems ridiculous for all of us to pay higher purchase prices just so that credit card users can get a portion back in the form of rewards. It would be better all around to just have lower purchase prices and ditch the reward programs.

Debit card rates are already capped by the 2010 Durbin amendment, but it has a loophole for small issuing banks; banks with less than $10 billion in assets are not subjected to this limitation. [2] And this loophole has been exploited, particularly by all of the fintech start ups. [3] 

> Think of a fintech company with a debit card. Square’s Cash App. Chime. Robinhood. Stripe Issuing, and users like Ramp and Bench. All of them, virtually without exemption, are brought to you courtesy of a small financial institution that you are unlikely to have heard of (unless you work in fintech or read Terms and Conditions for fun). Durbin exempt interchange is the revenue model which got a thousand pitch decks funded, because it is free to the ultimate consumer and protected by a moat guaranteed (for the moment) by Uncle Sam, contingent on the consumer choosing to use your app’s card.

Disclaimer: I work in fintech at a firm that could benefit from interchange caps and currently leverages the Durbin exemption. These are my personal thoughts and I’m not speaking on behalf of my employer.

E.g., having to submit a government id to any porn site. Further, I think this is just one instance of a general concern parents have about how their children use the internet, particularly social media.

Instead, I think we should empower parents to better regulate their children's internet usage; or in general better regulate digital screen usage. I imagine something like subsidizing locked-down devices for use by children. These devices would include extremely restrictive default permissions that block installing almost all apps as well as restrict the websites that can be visited by the device to a vanishingly small list. And of course there’d be restrictions on phone/SMS to only allow approved numbers.

It would also have time limits that prevent the child from using the device at common sleeping hours as well as limit the maximum time at which the device can be used continuously. E.g., you can only use it from 9 AM to 8 PM and you cannot use it for more than 30 minutes at a time without taking at least a 1 hour break.

Parents could then rollback restrictions as they see fit and keep rolling them back as the child ages. That would include allowing certain apps and websites at the parent’s discretion. E.g., you might not let your child use Twitter until they turn 30. App makers could offer child-specific versions that give app-specific controls that the parent can use to regulate usage of individual apps. E.g., a Twitter-for-children that requires the parent to approve each account follow and only shows content from followed accounts. There could also be the option to prevent posting or require each post to be approved by the parent before it becomes visible.

There may be some temptation for parents to be the “cool parent” that gives their child zero restrictions. But hopefully parents can use peer pressure on each other to enforce some common regulatory regime. And I think there is some value in letting groups of parents figure out the appropriate restrictions for their children in a highly localized manor."

I think it would be nice if Substack gave authors the ability to choose different comment-ranking algorithms, including using a custom one. That could include a sort of affirmative action boost whereby the author chooses commenters that have provided a track record of high quality comments from a perspective that is relatively rare. Comments from those users would get a boost in ranking. And some of us might need to be artificially downranked if we consistently dominate the discussion by providing a generically popular point of view.

I would even like to see Substack give us readers the option to bring their own ranking algorithm or to choose from a selection of algorithms with customization options. Of course I'm a software engineer that has strong opinions on social media algorithms so I might not be representative here.

Maybe that would offend some anti-abortion activists, although Republican candiates could sell this as fighting against federal abortion rights.

I guess I don’t have a good read on anti-abortion activists to know how this would play out.

I get the impression that many people are not familiar with this concept and it's particularly relevant around the discussion of corporate stock buybacks vs dividends to return capital to investors.

Like all things tax related there is some nuance to what counts as qualified dividend, but the gist is:
1. Hold the stock for sufficiently long (90 days) around the dividend date 
2. Is a US corp or an eligible foreign corp

Meeting these requirements are pretty simple for US investors that primarily invest domestically. You can read more about the requirements at https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qualifieddividend.asp

In return for investing domestically and being a long term investor, you pay substantially lower taxes. At most you pay 20% and there are brackets taxed at lower rates. E.g., a single person pays nothing on the first $38k of qualified dividends and 15% up to $425k."

One of her chief motivations for writing the book is to highlight the inequities of our current institutions with regard to people’s innate differences.

And these innate differences aren’t deterministically genetic. Due to random genetic shuffling, the genetic siblings of a single couple can still vary considerably. One child may receive a particularly favorable set of genetic gifts—favorable within our current institutions and social/economic structures—while their sibling may receive fewer. Yet neither sibling should be massively rewarded nor penalized in their dignity and quality of life due their luck of the “Genetic Lottery”."

As a mid-30s software engineer, I expect there’s going to be a lot of interest in part-time tech work over the coming decade or so as my cohort ages. From my biased sample of friends and coworkers, there doesn’t seem to be sufficient lifestyle creep to consume their increasingly high financial compensation.

I could see many tech workers' reasons that they’re set for a long retirement if they can just delay withdrawing for another decade to allow for more compounding. Plus, it’s nice to have something to do and many of us enjoy the work (or at least parts of the work).

I’ve known several software engineers in their 40s and 50s that have taken some informal approach to this. The general pattern is to withdraw from management and formal leadership roles and settle into more of an advisory role. That would entail lower compensation, but also lower responsibilities and more focus on mentorship and interesting technical problems. One engineer in particular would take year-long sabbaticals between roles at different companies; with a focus on finding a firm that could benefit from their experience in an advisory role. I’m confident that few of these engineers actually needed the money since they all joined pre-IPO companies that went on to 10x their market cap.

It would be challenging for a tech firm to provide part time roles in my opinion, particularly because so much time is already spent keeping up to speed on what is going on. Yet I bet there’s a lot of labor cost savings available if a firm can figure it out. I bet there’d be a lot of interest in half-time roles where the tech worker would take far less than half pay.

I’d like to contest the point that the poor are being disproportionately audited out of spite as reported in that WP piece. [1] From that article

> That is partly because the lowest-income filers are the ones getting the most enforcement: Households poor enough to receive the earned-income tax credit are five times more likely to be audited than higher-earning filers, according to research released by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

From what I’ve read, EITC audits are pretty simple and result from automatically detectable errors. A common example is two tax filers both claiming the same dependent child. This is trivially easy for the IRS to detect since you have to list the SSN of claimed dependents. And the IRS has found that EITC errors are quite common. [2]

> Over 26 million taxpayers receive over $64 billion in EITC benefits. The National Research Program (NRP) estimates that approximately 50% of EITC claims have errors and the $18.1 billion improper payments account for almost half of the $40 billion portion of the tax gap attributable to credits.

> In FY 2017, risk-based scoring identified about 6.4 million returns as claiming a potentially erroneous EITC due to a qualifying child issue or misreported income.

> The IRS planned to audit approximately 300,000 EITC returns for over the past 5 years and plans to continue to audit about 300,000 returns each year in the future. EITC correspondence audits are the most efficient use of available IRS examination resources with the average time to complete the audit of 5 hours per return.

Further, almost all EITC audits are correspondence audits; a small-scale audit where the IRS mails a form explaining the issue and asks the filer to either provide some proof or pay the difference of a revised tax filing. [3] These don’t take a lot of time and further provide the necessary clarification to prevent the same mistake in the future.

There is still a lot that could be done in terms of tax filer education, or even better an IRS-funded tax filing website. Similarly, with more funding for customer support the IRS will be able to provide more time in answering questions and helping people file the correct taxes initially.

Is there any evidence that a substantial number of rich people are cheating on their taxes? While there are certainly some individuals engaging in criminal tax evasion—possibly in context of other financial crimes like embezzlement and money laundering since they want to hide the proceeds of their crimes—I doubt this accounts for a significant amount of missing tax revenue.

Most rich people have highly-tractable income and have their finances managed by highly-informed accountants and lawyers. While the rich engage in substantial amounts of legal tax avoidance, I doubt few of their hired financial professionals are willing to help them engage in criminal tax evasion."

E.g., when Bezos sells $1B of AMZN he doesn’t get the proceeds in duffle bags of cash. Instead the transaction occurs electronically through brokers and banks that are reporting everything to the SEC and the IRS. Similarly, almost all transactions that rich people engage in occur through similar systems with electronic paper trails and automatic reporting to the government.

You mention “dodgy tax shelters”, but there are legal tax shelters and they require a substantial amount of registration and reporting. E.g., a trust is a legal entity that must conform to various federal and state law, including tax law. The structure, beneficiaries and contributors are all registered with the government and all financial transactions are subject to reporting. There just isn’t any shadowy area to hide anything."

In the rare cases where there is specific criticism, I find it flawed or based on misunderstandings. For example, Summers is commonly blamed for not pushing for more stimulus in the fallout of the Great Recession. Yet I think this was just Summers getting on board with the administration’s agenda. Obama and his top advisors wanted to go big on healthcare and didn’t think they had the political capital to also do a larger stimulus program. They felt they could do one or the other, but not both, and decided to go big on healthcare.

This would dovetail well with Biden’s recent actions on student loan forgiveness in that it would counter the criticism that he’s failing to address the underlying issue.

Biden could work with congress to revise higher education government lending criteria to be based on a financial cost/benefit calculator for the students of individual programs, including both students that graduate and those that fail to graduate. We’d simply estimate the expected median earnings of a student for a given program, at a given school, and then limit the loan amount such that repaying the loan doesn’t overburden someone earning that salary. 

For example, the median journalistic masters program graduate likely has rather dismal earnings prospects. That doesn’t mean that such a program can never pass a cost/benefit analysis, but instead the costs must be sufficiently low so that the graduate isn’t financially burdened. Some programs will go on a cost cutting binge to accommodate these requirements whereas others will simply close down.

Additionally, programs will be incentivized to optimize the outcomes of their students. That includes helping them on career searches in addition to ensuring they develop employable skills. Further, programs would be incentivized to weed out weak students that will likely be poorly served by the program since failure to graduate or failure to find gainful employment post graduation will negatively impact the programs expected financial benefit going forward.

I also like the idea of ensuring someone has some real skin in the game when determining the financial cost/benefit estimation. That could be the school’s themselves being at least partially responsible for defaulting students. Or the loans could be at least partially funded through private sources, with that debit subject to standard bankruptcy law."

E.g., something about Congress holding the power of the purse and they cannot delegate such large and open ended financial decisions to the Executive.

In that case Biden gets to be seen as being in favor of student loan forgiveness without having to suffer the consequences of doing so. Plus, he can rage against the Republican SCOTUS as being an enemy of democracy."

Are you referring to Summers’ advocacy for the repeal of Glass–Steagall via  Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act? If so, that legislation had little if any impact on the financial crisis. The separation of commercial and investment banks via GS was irrelevant since all of the problematic financial firms were pure investment banks. E.g., Lehman, Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch.

In fact a key part of containing the fallout was having the struggling investment banks be acquired at fire sale prices by commercial banks. E.g., Bear Stearns by JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch by Bank of America. The failed attempt to facilitate an acquisition of Lehman by Barclays led it to fail and is commonly cited as the trigger of the financial crisis.

I’d recommend the 2010 article, “The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999: A Bridge Too Far? Or Not Far Enough?” [1] to learn more about the impact of GLB and the financial crisis.

> This Article argues that critics are mistaken in attributing a connection between the GLBA and the financial crisis. In fact, the GLBA had very little, if anything, to do with the financial crisis. Virtually all of the actions that can properly be identified as causes of the crisis could have occurred, and probably would have occurred, even if the GLBA had never been enacted--indeed, even if the original Glass-Steagall barriers had remained wholly intact. Thus, a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act would achieve little, if anything, toward forestalling the kinds of actions that created the crisis or that might create a similar crisis in the future.

That can include limiting publicly funded education to a smaller portion of our population; possibly the portion that we believe will provide the most benefits to society with their education.

I disagree that these stated preferences are more authentic than the revealed ones. I think that incorrectly separates the rational mind from irrational impulses. Instead, I believe the mind is a combination of conscious thinking and subconscious impulses, with the latter including emotions and intuitions. There can commonly be conflicts between the two, but neither is more authentic.

In terms of addressing the conflict, I believe the rational mind can construct a better environment for the subconscious mind to operate into. For example, to consume a healthy diet I don’t keep any snacks nor alcohol in my home to remove these temptations. I also do a fair amount of meal planning to minimize the risk of overeating. As a result, I don’t find much of a conscious/unconscious conflict with regard to diet since the environment in which my subconscious operates doesn’t include these unhealthy temptations.

Instead, they’d be working in some labor job. These individuals would be the natural leaders of organized labor since they could not only well empathize with their fellow workers, they also had the talents and drive necessary to build and lead an organization.

1. It seems likely to devolve into partisan arguments with little common ground
2. I think the public would only pay attention if there was partisan controversy

And that is my hazy recollection of the Simpson-Bowles Commission. There wasn’t sufficient consensus to send a recommendation to Congress and the recommendation was controversial. From Wikipedia [1]

> The Commission's recommendations were politically controversial. Under the executive order that created the commission, a supermajority of 14 of the 18 commissioners had to agree to a recommendation before it was sent to Congress for a vote. In a vote in December 2010, the commission fell short of that requirement, with only 11 out of the 18 commissioners (five Republicans, five Democrats, and one independent) voting to endorse the commission's blueprint.

> Critics on the left, such as Democratic Representative Jan Schakowsky (a Commission member) and Paul Krugman, opposed the Simpson–Bowles proposal because it would cut entitlement and social safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Critics on the right, such as Republican commission members Paul Ryan, Jeb Hensarling, and Dave Camp, and anti-tax activist Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, objected to the Simpson-Bowles proposal because it would raise taxes.

I could see a commission on college costs similarly devolving into partisan fighting with Democrats focusing on insufficient public funding and Republicans focusing on administrative bloat (particularly things like DEI officers). In the unlikely event the commission found some boring middle ground consensus, then I don’t think anyone would pay any attention.

The most straightforward solution is to increase (or eliminate) the current payroll tax ceiling of $147k. But many Democratic politicians have decided that increasing taxes on anyone earning less than $400k is politically untenable. So they might have to propose making payroll taxes progressive or funding out of the general fund. And the recent BBB/IRA legislation fiasco shows how hard it is for Democrats to reach a consensus to raise any taxes.

Regardless of approach, it would require Democrats to champion a substantial tax increase—possibly including incomes below $400k—without any commensurate new benefits. Or they’d have to give ground to the Republicans and propose some benefits cuts such as increasing the retirement age for future beneficiaries.

I could see Republican welfare critics potentially garnering more support when their solutions are contrasted against alternative approaches that will allow the programs to be sustained. Although I personally hope we can just find a way to raise more tax revenue and don’t think we need to be so squeamish about further taxing incomes in the $100-400k range.

And hence deBoer doesn’t believe education is an effective way to address socioeconomic disparities since relative performance is what matters in the labor market.

Think he’s most recently summarized his thesis in “Education Doesn't Work 2.0”, https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/education-doesnt-work-20

> The brute reality is that most kids slot themselves into academic ability bands early in life and stay there throughout schooling. We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

In many ways, the anti-abortion activists remind me of some counterproductive climate activists that we Democrats have to deal with. E.g., activists that aim to end fossil fuel production in the US despite the fact the resulting surge in gas prices would be incredibly unpopular. From my poorly informed perspective, it appears the Republicans are doing a worse job managing their unpopular activists, with anti-abortion activists having a bigger seat at the table in developing Republican policy.

I am curious how Republicans will reconcile this issue within their party. Anti-abortion activists hold deep moral convictions—commonly informed by religion—and I don’t see how Republicans could ever reason with them. Yet I do wonder if these anti-abortion activists are sufficiently pragmatic to see how their deeply unpopular, extremist views could never be encoded in federal law. E.g., the whole personhood for fetuses amendment that some Republicans suggest. If so, Republicans may be able to bring them on board for a more moderate abortion policy position.

There are numerous hypotheses for the cause of this discrepancy and each has different implications for the current state of the US economy.

Joey Politano has a great recent article that presents some of these hypothesis in “The Trillion Dollar Question”, https://www.apricitas.io/p/the-trillion-dollar-question

1. Investment is Underestimated
2. Census Manufacturing Data is Underestimating Output and Investment
3. Profits are Overestimated
4. Aggregate Wages are Overestimated
5. Trade is Miscounted

The investment underestimation cause (#1) would imply that not only is our economy growing faster than shown in current GDP estimates but also that businesses are confident to invest in expanding supply. That would come as great relief, showing economic robustness and investments in addressing supply shortages that exasperate our current high inflation. Matt Klein has a great (paywalled) article covering this mechanism, https://theovershoot.co/p/is-the-2022h1-gdp-declinefake

In contrast, hypothesis #4, overestimation of aggregate wages, would imply a weaker labor market and that GDI is being overestimated. Politano summarizes a previous article of his that covers the technical mechanism of that discrepancy as, https://www.apricitas.io/p/labor-market-mystery-hour

> Last week we discussed the rising gap between America’s two labor market surveys—the establishment survey (which surveys businesses) and the household survey (which surveys individuals). The establishment survey shows robust job growth through both quarters while the household survey shows a slowdown in employment growth at the end of Q1.

Will be quite interesting to see how these GDP and GDI discrepancies are resolved in future revisions and which of these hypotheses turn out to be the cause. Could be a combination of multiple mechanisms and possibly causes that haven’t yet been proposed."

And I think they highlight a more general problem with a lot of public employment. We offer government workers lower salaries in exchange for higher job security and heavily back loaded compensation in the form of defined benefit pensions.

This employment arrangement is tempting for governments because it offers lower immediate costs in a current budget. But it’s penny wise and pound foolish in multiple ways. First, as discussed in this article, it filters out many potential employees who can get higher initial compensation elsewhere. Next, it leads to government employees fighting for excessively strong protections against getting fired.

Further, the backloaded defined benefits can financially cripple a government when these future liabilities are not sufficiently prefunded. And it’s always tempting to underfund to again keep the current budget lower. This can result in a growing financial burden as the liabilities come due and new tax revenue is needed to make up for the insufficient pension funds. The new taxes without a compensatory increase in services can lead residents to flee to lower tax jurisdictions which only compounds the problem. This doom loop can crush a city (and possibly one day a state).

Personally, I’d like to see all defined benefit pensions being outlawed since they have such perverse incentives to incur future liabilities without sufficient current outlays to fund them. Even when attempting to prefund liabilities with a pension fund there is always a temptation to assume overly optimistic returns from the investments in this fund. Since no one can predict the future of financial markets (nor the costs of future benefits like healthcare), governments can’t avoid the risk of these liabilities exceeding assets."

I don’t think we want teachers that are skilled at developing curriculum since it seems incredibly inefficient for each teacher to create their own. Instead, it seems curriculum development should be centralized with a small number of professionals developing textbooks and outline of lesson plans.

Maybe better lecturers? That again seems inefficient since we could instead have a small number of exceptional lecturers record presentations. The Khan Academy model seems quite enticing in that respect in that it assigns recorded lectures as homework and then uses class time for collaborative work on problem sets with help from the teacher and fellow students.

Do we just need them to maintain classroom order among a bunch of children? That certainly seems important, although I’m not sure that skillset is associated with higher SAT scores. I wouldn’t expect workers with exceptional talents in that area to have many other opportunities for alternative careers leveraging those skills.

I think Reddit determines how to balance age and likes based on historical performance of comments in a given subreddit. For example, Reddit’s algorithm would look at the top comment on an older post. That comment may have ended up with 100 likes and we can look at the timescale at which it acquired those likes. E.g., it may have gotten 7 likes in the first 5 minutes; 12 likes in the first 10 mins; and so on. Therefore Reddit could determine that 7 likes in 5 minutes suggest the comment will have 100 likes after a day or so.

Looking at the historical performance of many comments allows one to calibrate a prediction function that estimates the final performance of a comment using the number of early likes. And this algorithm can therefore rank comments based on their estimated final score."

Right now this doesn’t really matter for policy, but it could in a few months if those trends continue.

As I detailed in a previous comment on that June article, [1] the Fed is quite aware of the lag between market rents and CPI rent, and they use market rents in their inflation forecasts that guide their monetary policy. Hence, I think they’re unlikely to make a policy mistake based upon being overly focused on backward-looking indicators like CPI rent. They articulate this point with their regular invocation of the phrase, “monetary policy works with a long and variable lag.”

Instead, I think the biggest challenge that the Fed faces will be inflation volatility on the path back to target. There will be months where inflation appears trending downwards, for example July and Aug in which headline CPI were relatively low due to massive falls in gasoline prices. And it will be tempting to say that the job is done. Particularly, the Fed will be pressured by market participants, politicians, and pundits to end their hawkish policy when volatility gives us short periods of time in which inflation appears vanquished.

Yet I think Fed officials are aware of this challenge and tackling it head on. Powell well articulated this in his short Aug 26th speech at Jackson Hole. [2]

> That brings me to the third lesson, which is that we must keep at it until the job is done. History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting. The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now.

Yet the Fed cannot unilaterally ignore its Congressional mandate in an attempt to address these broader interests beyond its purview. E.g., it cannot pursue monetary policy coordination with other central banks.

The US can address these issues but should do so primarily through the Treasury Dept, particularly through its exchange stabilization fund. [1] Working in coordination with the fiscal authorities of other nations and the IMF, the Treasury could pursue a systemic devaluation of the dollar against other currencies. Based on the scale of the intervention, Congressional action may be needed to increase the available funds. E.g., authorizing more borrowing so that the Treasury can sell more dollars for other currencies.

The 1985 Plaza Accord is an example of the US Treasury working in coordination with other nations to achieve such a dollar devaluation. [2] Yet in our current high-inflation environment such an intervention would be incredibly unpopular. The historical analogous Plaza Accord was only possible after the Fed had sufficiently vanquished inflation earlier in the 80s. Similar to today, the dollar appreciated significantly throughout this hawkish monetary policy, yet US domestic politics could not consider the broader implications until inflation was addressed.

As someone who had to take Org I & II in college—and never use it again—I am sympathetic to this position since Org is a massive pain in the butt. And I had highly celebrated prof for both classes; a prof who was an amazing teacher as well as friendly and approachable. Plus a semester of intro Org in highschool. Nonetheless, I still found it a highly complex and non-intrusive subject matter that is notorious for inflicting pain on students and weeding many of them out.

So I can totally get on board with replacing a prof that isn’t a great teacher. And, again, I don’t have a great read on whether or not that is the case here.

The quantum mechanical effects that are relevant in Org push the limits of our ability to apply quantum mechanics, requiring PhD-level math, numerical approximations, and massive amounts of compute power. As a result, we can’t describe much of the physics relevant for Org in terms of simple principles that build on an understanding of QM, and QM itself is highly non intuitive. Instead, we get a plethora of rules that roughly describe the physics relevant for Org, but each rule has exceptions and the rules interact in unexpected ways. Students basically need to memorize the rules and apply them through route exercerizes to develop something of an intuition.

In contrast, biology accepts squishy narratives since hard rules fail. We can develop a simple story about the role of something like the mitochondria. We then expand that narrative with greater nuance and understanding as we focus on biological subcomponents, variation across species, impact of disease, and other factors. Each narrative is fractal in structure with subnaratives that add complexity. Eventually we run into specific biochemical processes that include chemical interactions and reactions where the rules of Org begin to provide some structure. 

Org has to live in this layer of rough, non-intuitive, approximate rules and squishy biological narratives."

Or at least it was circa 2007 when I applied to chemistry PhD programs. It was well accepted that you basically couldn’t get into any competitive program (e.g., Berkeley Chemistry) without at least 2 years of research experience. It was not uncommon for ambitious undergrads to have 4 years, including 3 fulltime summers.

Publication expectations differed by specialty and level-of-effort to do publishable work; synthesis might suffice with one non-first author paper whereas computational/theory required at least one first author paper since publications in the later field took less time/effort. Probably also needed at least one talk presentation (or at least poster presentation) at a regional meeting.

Yeah, you still needed some minimal GPA and GRE scores, but that was rarely the hurdle. Further, if your undergrad research advisor introduced you to a potential grad advisor, and the future advisor wanted you, then nothing else really mattered. Doubly so if your future grad advisor had funding for you. Exceptions could be made for anything. Such referrals were common and I even heard of professors competing for promising undergrads."

For example, how the Bank of England was forced to intervene in their government bond market to provide liquidity; i.e., buy longer dated bonds to prevent a collapse in their price when they had planned to instead start selling such bonds off their balance sheet in quantitative tightening. [1]

I imagine the Fed would similarly have to intervene if financial stability was at risk, even if intervention was at odds with their aim of tightening financial conditions. Yet I don’t currently see anyone predicting any specific part of the dollar financial system that is at risk. The analogy to the BoE is weak because the dollar financial system is simply far larger and deeper than the GBP. Particularly, there is ~$2.2 trillion of pure liquidity sitting in the Fed’s reverse repo facility, primarily from money market mutual funds, that can be deployed by investors to buy any asset that fails to an attractive price.

Further, all of the financial regulation following the financial crisis of 2008 has fortified the balance sheets of all banks and other systemically important financial institutions. Financial institutions are in a healthier place and the Fed has plenty of visibility into their balance sheet as well as tools for surgically addressing any potential issue.

Any policy that seeks to decrease the consumption of a significant enough portion of the electorate to affect inflation is going to be politically toxic. Just look at how we can’t even contemplate increasing taxes on anyone earning less than $400k/year.

I don’t think it matters what combination of tax increases and benefit decreases compose such an austerity policy. The simple fact that a non-trivial number of voters will see a proposal to decrease their spending power will lead to massive political blowback. I just don’t see how any politician could propose or support such a proposal without consigning themselves to future electoral defeat.

Although I do see some potential if there is some sort of external force constraining our options. For example, the new UK government has been forced into a U-turn when their hastily developed tax cuts and financial support for household energy bills led to turmoil in their government bond market as well as a rapid depreciation of their currency.

I guess something similar could happen in the US. My understanding is that a lot of the 90s concern about deficit was focused on “bond vigilantes” causing financial turmoil if investors lost faith in US government debt. E.g., Carville’s famous quote about wanting to be reincarnated as the bond market because, “You can intimidate everybody”."

But individual Democratic Party candidates keep squandering it by staking out a very odd “no restrictions on abortion under any circumstances”

As a Georgian, I was quite dismayed when Abrams brought up abortion as a solution when asked about inflation. [1]

> “But let’s not pretend that women — half the population — especially of childbearing age, they understand that having a child is absolutely an economic issue. It’s only politicians that see it as just another cultural conversation,” she added.

Georgia is still a very conservative state and I think this is a counterproductive way to discuss abortion. Here’s an example of how Republicans are weaponizing this to their advantage. [2]

It’s important for us to remember that there wasn’t significant inflation in Europe until Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which destabilized their energy markets and kicked off ruinous economic turmoil. In contrast, US inflation started picking up a year earlier in Spring of 2021.

To expand on the 1876 fallout, I would add the extremely contentious presidential election. Southern Democrats engaged in widespread electoral fraud, particularly disenfranchising Black Republicans. And southern Republican electoral officials—officials who oversaw these southern state elections as part of reconstruction—attempted to correct the situation by rejecting fraudulent votes. Even with those corrections that changed state-level results in several southern states the Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes only won nationally by a single electoral vote.

The conflict was resolved through the Compromise of 1877, which included an informal agreement to end reconstruction. Some excerpts from Wikipedia [1]

> It was one of the most contentious presidential elections in American history. Its resolution involved negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats, resulting in the Compromise of 1877, and on March 2, 1877 the counting of electoral votes by the House and Senate occurred, confirming Hayes as President.

> The results of the election remain among the most disputed ever. Although it is not disputed that Tilden outpolled Hayes in the popular vote, there were wide allegations of electoral fraud, election violence, and other disfranchisement of predominately-Republican Black voters.

> An informal, ""back-room"" deal was struck to resolve the votes: the Compromise of 1877. In the deal, the Democrats conceded the 20 contested electoral votes to Hayes, resulting in a 185-184 victory; in return, the Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, marking the end of Reconstruction.

Ian Shapiro (Yale polisci prof) has convinced me that proportional representation is an insufficient solution to the problems of first-past-the-post voting. He instead argues that the actual issue is strong vs. weak parties. Specifically, weak parties encourage extreme candidates since they are chosen and funded by highly-engaged zealots. In contrast, with strong parties the leadership can strategically select moderate candidates that appeal to the median voter.

Further, with PR and weak parties, coalitions can fracture into smaller and increasingly extreme parties. E.g., the rise of far right wing parties throughout Europe in the last decade. And with PR, parties are incentivized to focus on single issues (e.g., opposing immigration) and make that a condition of them joining a governing coalition. This can result in odd governments that few voters would select. E.g., when a right party and left party form a government, excluding the moderate party, such as Greece in 2015.

[1] His basic idea is to separate Twitter into a backend service that hosts content and a front end client that provides moderation and algorithmic curation. Twitter would then open the backend up so that anyone can develop their own client by paying for access.

The backend would do the minimal amount of moderation necessary to conform with the law in each jurisdiction and then provide optional services to the clients for more sophisticated moderation and algorithmic filtering and ranking. Twitter would continue to host their existing front end and possibly create more over time.

The idea is that the plethora of clients would allow for experimentation and meeting the diverse user preferences. You could have heavily moderated clients as well as wild west anything goes. While all clients would reference the same social graph and tweets/replies, each client could use whatever methods they want for filtering and ranking.

Some possible clients I’ve considered.

1. A client geared towards journalists and other prominent people that provides them with a layer that filters out harassment. This could include manual curation of their DMs, replies and retweets. The service would also have a team of lawyers for reporting credible threats of violence to law enforcement and sending cease-and-desist letters for proper libel.

Jackson has fallen out of favor over the last few decades due to his atrocities against the Native Americans. But before that he was revered as the founder of the Democratic party and as the first American populist. Jackson appealed to a substantially broader section of our people and his election was seen as symbolizing the expansion of the franchise beyond aristocratic landowning elites.

Personally, I think he at least deserves a lot of credit for skillfully navigating the 1832 nullification crisis. It was an initial test of whether states had to abide by federal laws (in this case tariffs) or whether they could nullify them. This early north/south conflict could've fractured our United States and I believe Jackson was uniquely qualified to preserve our union.

He was able to negotiate a compromise consisting of a reduction of the tariffs while also promising to crush any rebellion against them. Jackson’s credibility as a southerner (or at least a western agrian) helped him sell this deal to the tariff opponents. And I think we can assume that he was also aided by his reputation as a mercurial psychopath who would’ve gladly led an army to execute every government official in a rebellious state.

Without Jackson, particularly with a John Quincy Adams-esque president, our United States might’ve been nothing more than a short-lived experiment that simply demonstrated the follies of democracy."

Many, if not most, tech companies are extremely reluctant to fire engineers for performance reasons until they run into a cash flow issue and have to do layoffs. You’ll find this general consensus across tech forums (e.g., Hackers News). I believe this is the case for a multitude of reasons.

First, engineers are among the most expensive employees to hire and onboard. A lot of resources go into recruiting, including numerous interviews with existing engineers and managers. And many candidates get rejected or reject the company. This adds up to a lot of time and money (guessing high 5 figures) just to hire one engineer.

Further, it can take months for an engineer to get up to speed at an established company due to all of the proprietary tech and knowledge. And engineers grow in value for years as they pick up more tribal knowledge of the firm’s codebase and systems.

Second, engineers on the same team become non-fungible due to working on different projects. We certainly try to minimize this by rotating people on to different projects so that they can gain more tribal knowledge. Yet every team member becomes the canonical expert on different systems since they simply have worked on different projects.

Third, there rarely is any short term value to firing a low performing engineer. Yes, some of us are an actual net negative by worsening the codebase quality or breaking things that require other people’s help to fix. Yet that is rare. More likely is a “quiet quitter” that makes some minimal, yet positive contribution. You’ll find numerous self-reporting on Hacker News of engineers only working 10 hours a week at FAANG firms.

Fourth, engineers have short tenures, commonly jumping to another firm in two years. It’s an open secret that an internal promotion at almost all tech companies is harder than simply getting hired at that higher level at a comparable firm. There’s a lot of debate among engineers about whether that is due to a failure of internal promotion processes or a failure of the hiring processes. And of course the most ambitious and highest performers are jumping firms more frequently.

So in summary, engineers are expensive to hire, possess valuable differential tribal knowledge, are almost always a positive contribution to the team, and constantly leaving anyways. So there’s just no reason to manage out low performers unless the firm runs into cash flow issues."

Contemporary tech is just too incentivized around growth over margins; until recently it has been growth at all costs.

One could argue that the rigorous barriers to internal promotion partially address the issue. We simply have way more info about current employees relative to potential hires. If someone is barely performing at their current level then their manager can at least withhold promotion. Whereas on the hiring side we all gotta make our best guess and aren’t incentivized to correct mistakes.

As an aside, I have gotten to work with an old school tech team when the startup that I was at got reverse acquired by a firm founded in the 60s. (I.e., parent company moved assets and teams to us and then sold everything else—including the parent company’s name—to another firm.) That team had what I’d consider a culture of costs and benefits rather than growth at all costs. They had been through layoffs and recognized the value in managing out low performers to control their costs.

In merging into the eng org, the OGs adopted its tech culture for compatability, although they could certainly joke about some of the absurdities. Yet I imagine they all still have their hard-learned lessons, and it’s not surprising that their top manager eventually became the VP of engineering a few years post-merge. I imagine that eng org is now particularly well positioned as we exit the current tech boom and cost/benefit trade offs matter again."

Many banks didn’t even need the funds, but Paulson wanted every bank to take funds so that counterparties wouldn’t interpret some banks as being in a relatively weak position. That would certainly cause depositors (particularly institutions) to withdraw funds from perceived weak banks.

So TARP funding was structured on particularly favorable terms and Paulson/Bernanke promised them hell from their bank examiners if any bank refused the funds. The CEOs recognized the logic of collective action, saw the chance for cheap funding on good terms, and they all agreed.

The collapse of Lehman is insightful to what could’ve happened. Paulson tried to engineer some acquisitions, but CEO Dick Fuld kept pushing acquirers for better terms. He really lived up to his name! He waited too long and eventually only Barclays was still at the table.. Fuld reluctantly agreed to rough terms, but the British government blocked the deal; and for good reasons.

I think he was also chosen because he was an alternative Bork that the Senate Democrats couldn’t so easily bork because he was a Black justice. (And yes, that is where that verb comes from.)

PBS’s “Supreme Revenge” documentary presents a compelling narrative that our current SCOTUS Justice battles began with the rejected confirmation of Robert Bork in 1987. [1] (I highly recommend watching it.) He was a Reagan nomination and a highly controversial choice; primarily due to his opposition to previous court decisions on civil rights based upon his constitutional originalism theories.

With the Democrats holding the Senate, Ted Kennedy and Joe Biden led the opposition on the grounds that Bork was an extremist with highly regressive views. Ultimately 52 Democrats and 6 Republicans voted against confirmation.

It can be argued that Thomas held similar jurisprudence views, but the Democratic Senate had a harder time criticizing and opposing a Black justice. And Thomas leaned into that when condemning his critics allegations of sexual harassment (which he denied) in the Senate hearings. [2]

You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree.

For a good overview of the messy process that led to an underwhelming ARRA, I’d recommend the 2012 New Yorker article, “The Obama Memos”, section “2. An Economic Judgment”,  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/the-obama-memos

> Summers informed Obama that the government was already spending well beyond its means. Yet in the coming months Obama would have to sign, in addition to a stimulus bill, several pieces of legislation left over from the Bush Administration: a hundred-billion-dollar funding bill for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; perhaps three hundred and fifty billion dollars more in funds from Bush’s tarp program, to prop up banks; and a four-hundred-and-ten-billion-dollar spending bill that was stuck in Congress. Obama would need resources to save G.M. and Chrysler, which were close to bankruptcy, and to address the collapsing housing market, which he was told would be hit with five million foreclosures during his first two years in office. Summers cautioned Obama, who had run as a fiscal conservative and attacked his Republican opponent for wanting to raise taxes, that he was about to preside over an explosion of government spending: “This could come as a considerable sticker shock to the American public and the American political system, potentially reducing your ability to pass your agenda and undermining economic confidence at a critical time.”

> There was an obvious tension between the warning about the extent of the financial crisis, which would require large-scale spending, and the warning about the looming federal budget deficits, which would require fiscal restraint. The tension reflected the competing concerns of two of Obama’s advisers. Christina Romer, the incoming chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, drafted the stimulus material. A Berkeley economist, she was new to government. She believed that she had persuaded Summers to raise the stimulus recommendation above the initial estimate, six hundred billion dollars, to something closer to eight hundred billion dollars, but she was frustrated that she wasn’t allowed to present an even larger option. When she had done so in earlier meetings, the incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, asked her, “What are you smoking?” She was warned that her credibility as an adviser would be damaged if she pushed beyond the consensus recommendation.

> Peter Orszag, the incoming budget director, was a relentless advocate of fiscal restraint. He was well known in Washington policy circles as a deficit hawk. Orszag insisted that there were mechanical limits to how much money the government could spend effectively in two years. In the Summers memo, he contributed sections about historic deficits and the need to scale back campaign promises. The Romer-Orszag divide was the start of a rift inside the Administration that continued for the next two years.

I particularly recall there being a concern that going big on stimulus could jeopardize the Obama administration's ambitious healthcare plans. The ARRA was already quite contentious and partisan; not getting a single Republican House vote and only getting 3 Republican Senators, despite the inclusion of many tax cuts to woo Republicans."

And I believe a lot of the opposition within the administration came from Peter Orszag, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who had long been a deficit hawk. From Wikipedia, [1]

> Orszag, in a November 2009 speech in New York, said that deficits, which were expected to add $9 trillion to the existing national debt of $12 trillion over the next decade, are ""serious and ultimately unsustainable."" He said that deficit spending was necessary to help boost the economy when unemployment is hovering around 10 percent. But he said that red ink must be stopped as the economy recovers. During a recovery, private investment will again pick up and compete with the federal government for capital. In 2011, he was described by New York Magazine as a ""deficit hawk and clashed with Larry Summers, who wasn’t as focused on the long-term debt crisis.""

> In July 2010 Orszag said that ""The problem now is weak growth and high unemployment rather than outright economic collapse"". Still, the deficit would be equivalent to 10 percent of the gross domestic product, the highest level since World War II. The Office of Management and Budget's mid-session review, forecast a smaller deficit and stronger economic growth than the administration's initial budget release. The deficit forecast in 2011 increased to $1.42 trillion, up from the $1.27 estimate in February. For 2012, the deficit estimate rose to $922 billion, up from $828 billion in the previous report. The annual budget shortfall would bottom out in 2017 at $721 billion, or 3.4 percent of GDP, and begin rising again in following years.

But again, the problem isn’t the bank’s operational independence, it’s the way the EU doesn’t allow for any efficient decision-making process by its elected elements.

The problem with the European Central Bank is that they have the impossible problem of managing the monetary policy for a monetary union that lacks a fiscal union. The governments of Germany and Italy require substantially different monetary policy to complement the differences in their fiscal policy. In my opinion, Italy and other peripheral states need currency devaluation to help manage their debt load and stimulate economic growth. Whereas Germany wants a strong currency to minimize inflation while they use their massive fiscal space to support industry and residents through the temporary energy crisis.

If the eurozone was a proper fiscal union, then there could be large fiscal transfers from Germany to Italy to balance out the different economies. This would be comparable to the large fiscal transfer between California and Alabama in the US. With a single fiscal policy, the ECB could create the appropriate monetary policy.

There are all sorts of eurozone/EU rules that attempt to minimize discrepancies between the fiscal policies of different member states. But in practice, it’s my understanding that they don’t accomplish much beyond stroking animosity between the different states when they accuse each other of incompliance. And then the ECB has to manage this impossible problem with esoteric financial instruments (e.g., heterogeneous PEPP reinvestment) that poorly mimics a fiscal union."

I will concede that I have not researched this question deeply and I am open to changing my mind, but the way I see it, Apple is just not a monopolist in the phone market so there is no antitrust question here — it’s two big companies slugging it out to divide some rents.

If anyone wants to learn more, the tech analyst Ben Thompson has a lot of resources on App Tracking Transparency at, https://stratechery.com/topic/app-stores/app-tracking-transparency-att/

Particularly his June 2022 article, “Data and Definitions”, https://stratechery.com/2022/data-and-definitions/

I’d highlight these two paragraph

> “Tracking” is not a neutral term! My strong suspicion — confirmed by anecdata — is that a lot of the most ardent defenders of Apple’s ATT policy are against targeted advertising as a category, which is to say they are against companies collecting data and using that data to target ads. For these folks I would imagine tracking means exactly that: the collection and use of data to target ads. That certainly seems to align with the definition of “track” from macOS’s built-in dictionary: “Follow the course or trail of (someone or something), typically in order to find them or note their location at various points”.

> However, this is not Apple’s definition: tracking is only when data Apple collects is linked with data from third parties for targeted advertising or measurement, or when data is shared/sold to data brokers. In other words, data that Apple collects and uses for advertising is, according to Apple, not tracking; the privacy policy helpfully lays out exactly what that data is (thanks lawyers!):

Apple narrowly defines tracking as linking data across companies. E.g., between Facebook and a retailer measuring the performance of sales resulting from FB ads. Apple prohibits that. In contrast, Amazon can track and link everything that happens on their app since they both show the ads and process sales within one company. Similarly, Apple is tracking and linking a lot of data on its own platform to optimize its own ad business. Hence, Apple is still allowing a lot of tracking and data collection, and just banning that which isn’t useful to its own business.

Thompson has made the argument that Apple may have implemented ATT primarily to kneecap the free, ad-supported app ecosystem and thereby drive more apps to a paid model; with Apple getting their 30% cut on any purchase or subscription in their AppStore.

That theory is particularly damning given WSJ’s April 2022 reporting in “The Secret Talks That Could Have Prevented the Apple vs. Facebook War”, https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-apple-vs-facebook-privacy-fight-11660317376

And don’t forget LBJ’s badgering. The Richmond Fed even has an article on that debacle in, “1965: The Year the Fed and LBJ Clashed”, https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2016/q3-4/federal_reserve

> Few challenges to the Federal Reserve's independence have ever matched the drama of Dec. 5, 1965. Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. had just convinced the Board of Governors to raise the discount rate amid signs that the economy was starting to overheat. Fiscal stimulus — increased spending on the Vietnam War, expanded domestic programs for President Lyndon Johnson's ""Great Society,"" and a tax cut enacted in 1964 — had raised inflationary warning signals for Martin and, increasingly, a majority of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). But Johnson was adamant that higher rates would slow down the economy and compromise his domestic agenda. Enraged, he called Martin and other top economic officials to his Texas ranch, where he was recovering from gallbladder surgery.

> Johnson finally relented, and Martin's refusal to back down is often considered one his strongest moments as Fed chairman. His relationship with the president was sometimes strained in the following years. But the 1965 showdown was seen as a tough lesson to Johnson that the Fed would flex its muscles when needed to push back against the inflationary pressures caused, in part, by his administration's own policies.

> What is less often remembered in the popular mind is that the rate hike of 1965 did not, in fact, turn a corner on inflation. In the years that followed, fiscal stimulus was ample, war spending kept rising, and the deficit grew. But FOMC members were often divided, and their policy decisions reflected this ambivalence. Furthermore, while Martin saw monetary and fiscal policymakers as obligated to work together to promote price stability and growth, he discovered that dealing with this particular White House and Congress was often a one-way street. And even though the Fed was substantially upgrading its analytic capacity in the 1960s — hiring more Ph.D. economists, building up its research departments, and adopting forecasting — it didn't always translate into consistent monetary policymaking."

Worse, it seems that they accepted FTT as collateral for all sorts of crypto loans; notably massive loans to SBF’s other company, the trading firm Alameda Research. And to make this even more absurd, the value of FTT was largely based around FTX’s financial performance since they committed to using profits to buy back and burn FTT. I.e., FTT functioned as an unregistered FTX stock.

It’s like JP Morgan listing their own JPM stock as the primary asset collateralizing loans that they made; and these loans were made to the JPM CEO’s own hedge fund.

I’d add the concepts of fixed costs vs. variable costs as a contributing factor to why suppliers decrease quantity with a price cap.

* Fixed costs: Costs a supplier pays regardless of quantity sold
* Variable costs: Cost per-a-unit of production

In the Popeyes example
* Fixed: Lease, maintenance, wages of a minimal crew
* Variable: Ingredients, wages of additional workers at busy times

With the price ceiling, Popeyes could find that sales after 10 PM doesn’t provide enough revenue to offset the costs of the minimum crew needed to operate a store. They could also find that some locations should be closed since they don’t bring in enough revenue to cover their fixed costs regardless of hours of operation."

Rather than changing people’s minds, we might just force our compatriot interlocutors to double down as that is a instinctive ego defense mechanism.

Like many Republicans, including Trump, DeSantis likely favors tax cuts for the rich. And like Trump, he may evade explicitly stating that policy position should he run for president. Even in debates with the Democratic candidate, DeSantis could deflect when pressed on that specific issue.

Trump himself didn’t seem to pay much of a price for his tax cuts for the rich in the 2020 presidential election. It could be because Trump was defined by numerous other issues of higher salience. DeSantis could similarly avoid making this an issue in the 2024 election by leaning into non-fiscal issues, like immigration and culture war stuff."

Antoine Gara, Kadhim Shubber and Joshua Oliver at the Financial Times reported on Saturday:

Even if the firms were still founded, the founders would’ve been forced to sell a much larger portion of their ownership far earlier and thereby lose control earlier. The trajectory of these companies would be much different and likely far less impressive. Although, the more likely scenario is that we simply have far less entrepreneurship.

While these firms certainly have problems, they all still make massive contributions to America’s economy by collectively employing millions and contributing hundreds of billions of economic activity. We’d be a far poorer society without the goods and services that were invented by these firms.

Now with inflation running high and the Fed being a net treasury seller through quantitative tightening, there is the opposing concern of a treasury glut. [2]

My simplistic understanding is that our current global financial system couldn’t work without the large and growing supply of US treasuries. They are the safest financial asset because they are backed by the most powerful military and from a government that also provides the global reserve currency. For corporations and institutional investors, treasuries are even safer than bank deposits since FDIC insurance is limited to $250k. There is just nothing else comparable to US treasuries.

Therefore treasuries are used all throughout the financial system. They serve as both long term reserves as well as collateral for short term funding through repurchase agreements (repo); basically borrowing cash against treasuries.

I believe the global financial system would become far more riskier and volatile if treasuries were slowly phased out. There’d probably be a need for the US government to create some sort of replacement; possibly expanding FDIC insurance or creating some new Federal Reserve facility for guaranteeing deposits. But the simplest solution is to continue running a federal budget deficit.

Pelosi deserves a ton of credit for getting TARP done since there was a lot of Republican opposition within the House. The bill only passed due to Democratic support. [1]

> The revised HR1424 was received from the Senate by the House, and on October 3, it voted 263-171 to enact the bill into law. Democrats voted 172 to 63 in favor of the legislation, while Republicans voted 108 to 91 against it

So GW Bush had to work with Pelosi and House Democrats to get TARP done. We came dangerously close to a total market meltdown while House Republicans started to embrace some anti-technocratic populist opposition against their own party’s president.

My understanding is that the Republican opposition to TARP was the infancy of the Tea Party. As a Reason 2014 article explains, these Republicans were responding to rising populist sentiments within their party with the 2008 elections just a month away. [2]

> Karl Rove explained that Republicans literally feared for their political futures over this one vote.
> Some of the grassroots fervor is evidenced in the 60,000+ signatures collected at NoWallStreetBailout.com in the fall of 2008. A sampling of the petition signers' comments sounds a lot like the eventual tea party movement: 
>> ""No Wall Street or auto bailouts! Maybe Americans should boycott paying 2008 federal income tax—no income tax revenue, no bailout.""
>> ""This bailout could end up breaking the spirit that underlies the true American way.  The key word is ""RESPONSIBILITY!""  WHERE IS IT?!

If it wasn’t for Pelosi’s leadership and pragmatic approach to a highly technocratic financial crisis, then our global financial system would’ve melted down while Republican politicians worried about appeasing their increasingly ornery populist base.

Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, put that alternative on the table at the White House on Thursday afternoon, a verbal brawl broke out, scuttling a grand compromise and forcing negotiators back to the table.

Yet, I find Bergner totally unconvincing in his request for changing our current medical and social approach to managing psychosis. Further, I find it a little terrifying that he fully rejects the usage of the word “sick” to describe any cases of mental illness. I’d be greatly relieved if he could at least admit that some individuals cannot function in our society without medication; barring that involuntary commitment is our only option. I’d even give him the copout that such approaches could change over time as we learn more about non-medication therapies.

In their discussion, he even concedes that anorexia may be a different type of mental illness for which we cannot simply allow someone to embrace their delusions. It would seem that Bergner could similarly concede that some cases of psychosis cannot be managed without medicine or involuntary commitment given our current understanding of these diseases. He could still make the argument that medical researchers and practitioners should explore non-medication treatment. 

And he could further ask the rest of us in society to be open to changing how we think about psychosis as the medical understanding and therapies evolve. Yet Bergner’s failure to concede that some people are truly sick in a way that currently requires antipsychotic medication has me outright rejecting his argument as being too dangerous."

I’m tempted to believe that the rejection of material wealth can at times be a form of sour grapes. I.e., some people see material comfort as being unattainable for themselves and therefore reject it as something worth pursuing. Such a disposition would serve as an ego defense mechanism. I find this theory particularly appealing when degrowth advocates demand to impose their beliefs on others; including others with more financial success.

Yet on reflection, that hypothesis just seems lazy, biased, and self-serving. There is likely more to the psychological appeal of degrowth that I just don’t yet understand.

There’s a lot in this article that I like and agree with, yet this point in particular resonated with me. Opposition to free riding seems like a right-coded belief, and despite that, I as a progressive liberal believe this is an essential foundation of society.

At some level, I think all people have an intuitive disgust of freeloaders. We might disagree about who are the worst offenders: are they billionaires living opulent lives from the proceeds of other’s labor or welfare cheats who live off the largess of the government? Yet, at a deep emotional level, everyone is offended by the idea of free riders in our society.

Further, the psychological hardware that opposes mooching seems essential to human cooperation and flourishing society. When people begin to believe that others are gaming the system for unjust rewards, then they lose trust in institutions and society at large. For example, look at how tax evasion has become endemic in south Europe, which only adds to their fiscal and economic problems.

I believe it would be productive for all of us across the political spectrum to accept and even embrace this aspect of human psychology. For example, Democratic politicians could recognize freerider aversion as a challenge to address in welfare policy design. We’d likely have more success in persuading voters to support welfare expansion if we communicate our concern about gaming the system, and further explain how we’ll defend against cheaters, including punishing them. Similarly, Republicans might have more success in generally lowering taxes on the rich if they are willing to call out and prosecute the worst cases of tax evasion by the wealthy."

On a slightly more serious note, I’ve been surprised at the level of youth engagement with politics. [1] Even if some of this reporting is overblown, I couldn’t imagine anyone describing my elder-millennial cohort as politically engaged when we were teenagers; even as college students I believe vanishingly few of us ever went further than a lazy, “Fuck Bush.”

In my teenage years, political engagement would’ve been extremely uncool. Sure, we could embrace some generic anti-establishment views; even echo some of the political slogans from our favorite RATM songs. But to actually care about concrete electoral politics would be super lame. Like even among my nerdiest friend group, I imagine we’d mercilessly tease anyone that attempted to converse about the policy proposals of Gore or Kerry vs. Bush.

If even teens and college students are finding politics engaging today, then we desperately need better entertainment alternatives. Even a resurgent radical anti-establishment political media would be great as long as they deride the entire US political system. We need to make Rage Against the Machine great again!

My current solution to this conflict is two-fold:

I have no interest in early retirement because I get a lot of meaning out of having a job. If I no longer need to save/invest then I might as well donate a lot and I believe I’ll be able to do so for decades in the future.

In contrast, I see a strong safety net as essential for a robust liberal, democratic, and capitalistic society. But that is more of a reasoned argument.

To my fellow capitalists who are skeptical of welfare, consider the following: With a sufficiently muscular welfare state, we may be able to create and embrace an even more competitive form of capitalism; a capitalism based around a level of cold, calculating, psychopathic profit maximization that would even frighten Ayn Rand.

In my opinion, this is an instance of a more general problem within the current American leftist thought: denial of constraints and tradeoffs. They view such considerations as capitalistic, or neoliberal, and therefore refuse to acknowledge them.

For a hypothetical extreme example, imagine a new medical procedure that could extend the life of someone at an age of 90 for another 3 months at a cost of $1,000,000. A pragmatic progressive could argue that medicare shouldn’t cover this procedure following a cost benefit analysis. Yet American leftists would argue that we can’t put a dollar value on human life and therefore no cost is too great for any medical procedure.

Even ignoring the capitalistic stain of dollars doesn’t fully ameliorate such tradeoff considerations. For example, one could argue that there are only X doctors currently capable of performing this procedure, and there is an opportunity cost in that they can’t provide other more beneficial procedures. American leftists would counter that the real problem is insufficient doctors, and at most might begrudgingly accept there are some minimal short term tradeoff considerations. They would largely deflect the hard tradeoff question by pivoting to this idealistic one.

This is incredibly frustrating for us pragmatic progressives because constraints and tradeoffs exist in all political economic systems. Even Marxist ones! Should a communist revolution succeed in the US today, then tomorrow we’d still be faced with many of the same constraints and tradeoffs. Particularly, we’d have to consider consumption now vs. investing in the future.

Continuing the healthcare example, our Marxist government might want to aggressively expand doctor training so that we can provide more beneficial procedures in the future. Yet that would require more medical teachers and mentors; a role that is primarily provided by our current doctors. Just focusing solely on personnel constraints, we’d have to determine how to allocate our current medical professionals to practicing medicine vs. training new doctors. To aggressively expand doctor training for the future, we’d have to significantly decrease the availability of medical procedures in the present.

In our Marxist America, I’d much rather discuss and debate these medical tradeoffs with Jeff Bezos (our Czar of Logistics) than our current American leftists, who I would expect to continue denying constraints and tradeoffs. They’d likely label these concerns as reactionary propaganda and focus on a good-old-fashioned leftist purge."

I do think there are some interesting academic exercises in exploring the interaction of finance and climate. E.g., as we progress through the green transition, could fossil fuel infrastructure become stranded assets that no longer generate sufficient cash flow to pay off their debt financing? And could the resulting wave of defaults within the fossil fuel industry create stress on systemically important banks and other financial institutions?

Yet in practice I don’t think there is currently anything actionable from such academic work. Therefore I believe that the Raskin op-ed was academic malpractice in suggesting that there was. For that reason, Biden should not have nominated her to the Fed Board of Governors. Thankfully Manchin saved us yet again.

Further, I think there is a more general problem of searching for the “one clever” trick to achieve action on climate change when conventional politics fails. See also ESG investing. But for a problem as massive as climate change, there are no clever tricks. We instead need good policy that works within our current political reality; that includes considerations of constraints and tradeoffs.

Notably, we need to accept that the mass majority of voters care a lot about the price of energy.

From Bloomberg's Nov 4th article, ""Climate Change Eclipsed by Inflation, Crime, Abortion in US Midterm Races"". [1]

> “Will it be an electoral force in the 2022 midterms? No,” says Danielle Deiseroth, lead climate strategist at the progressive research firm Data for Progress. “The data shows that, and it’s just the fact of where we are right now.” Instead, abortion, inflation and public safety are among voters’ top priorities going into election day on Nov. 8. 

> Other recent polls show climate change is not a top voter priority. While Democratic voters report caring strongly about the issue, they cited it as their second “extremely important” issue behind abortion in a recent Gallup poll, and their fifth “very important” issue behind the future of democracy, health care, abortion, and Supreme Court nominees in an Oct. 16-20 Pew Research Center poll. 

Hence, I think there is a lot of truth to the narrative that aggressive action on climate change—including prioritization over other issues—is more of a minority, elitist position. Just a lot easier to make climate our number one priority when earning a top 5% income in a stable career.

The idea of federated (i.e., many independent) servers that can optionally link to each other (i.e., include each other's content) sounds enticing. 

I particularly like the idea of different servers experimenting with different approaches to moderation and algorithmic ranking. That would allow different communities to better meet the unique needs of their members. The experimentation could also discover novel approaches to the moderation and algorithm challenges that could be adopted by mainstream social media sites.

Yet even I can’t be bothered to search for the appropriate server to join and go through the rather involved process to set up an account. I’ve browsed a few public servers without an account and haven’t discovered any discussions that are particularly captivating. Further, I’ve heard stories of petty site owners/moderators banning users for arbitrary reasons; mainly because they felt like it. Just doesn’t seem worth the effort.

If anything, I’m actually finding substack comment sections to the superior federated social media. Chiefly, here on Slow Boring. (Although in some ways this is just rediscovering the internet forums of the 90s.)

Kinda makes sense how the paywall and lower scale makes these sites less enticing to trolls and spammers. Similarly, there are fewer opportunities for partisan enemies to encounter each other since we all at least agree on paying for the author’s unique content. Further, each substack owner can adopt their own moderation policies that they believe are appropriate for their own brand.

Curious if Substack might ever wanna offer some functionality to support the “linking” idea of the fediverse. For example, two authors with different, yet ideological overlapping communities could co-publish an article and allow subscribers from both sites to comment. There would certainly be more opportunities for conflict. But with some more hands-on moderation it could be a decent opportunity to encounter ideas from a different tribe. Site owners would likely only use this feature sparingly."

They show how our current AI can leverage its superior memory and speed to provide a rough draft of an image, article, or computer program based upon concise, high-level instructions from a human creator. Yet the AI can neither self-inspire an idea nor get all of the details right. The human must therefore still do the challenging work of devising the novel idea as well as proof-read the draft work produced by the AI and correct small mistakes.

I recommend Joseph Heath's article, “Why Are Racial Problems in the United States So Intractable?”, for an overview of how different countries, including Singapore, have addressed race and ethnic issues. The article then contrasts these approaches against those of the US.

https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/08/why-are-racial-problems-in-the-united-states-so-intractable/

Heath identifies two types of approaches that countries have taken: 1) integration/assimilation and 2) multinationalism. Singapore is a particularly aggressive approach to the first whereas Canada's semi-sovereign, French-speaking province is an example of the second.

> As an involuntarily incorporated minority group, African Americans have little interest in following the immigrant route to integration. Yet they cannot constitute a nation within a nation, largely due to geographical dispersion, which effectively blocks the standard set of multinational arrangements. As a result, the United States has pursued an approach that tries to blend elements of both, without resounding success. Is there a new and different model that would achieve social integration, while satisfying African Americans’ desire to achieve equality without aban­doning their distinctive group identity?

> The most visible tendency among African Americans since the late 1960s has  been to act in the way that national minority groups act, by promoting group identification or “race consciousness” (and by con­demning “color-blindness” as involving a failure of recognition). This has the effect of increasing the salience of race in everyday interactions. If a multinational solution were feasible, this cultural politics would be useful. Unfortunately, it tends to undermine integrationist goals, since it blocks one of the major strategies used in successful models of polyethnic integration. (The recent American trend of seeking to promote “uncomfortable” conversations about race in everyday interaction represents an extreme form of this tendency.)

> The integrationist ideal that is associated with Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement has conditioned Americans to expect both social integration of African Americans on the polyethnic model and satisfaction of outcome-based measures of successful inclusion. But in neither case have Americans, either white or black, been willing to accept the means necessary to achieve these ends. This is what underlies the policy dilemmas that I have been trying to describe. The commitment to the preservation of a distinct African American culture and identity and the aversion to compulsory forms of inclusion have clearly worked at cross-purposes with the objectives specified by the integrationist ideal. Unwilling to decide which option to pursue, or more often, deeply divided over which option to pursue, African Americans have been unable to formulate a unified set of demands. Lack of direction from the black community has, in turn, generated near-complete paralysis on the issue among progressive whites. Absent any coherent policy agenda, white Americans have turned increasingly inward, toward extreme forms of confessional self‑criticism."

I think many of us, including myself at times, struggle to empathize with how strongly many Americans value personal gun ownership. And I have owned a gun! Thankfully, I’ve known many other gun owners, almost all of whom are Democrats, and I’ve got some exposure to their beliefs.

To them, the right to personal gun ownership is comparable to the personal-autonomy right to an abortion. While both groups might be able to begrudgingly accept some constraints, neither will support politics that challenge the fundamental validity of the right.

Yep, and think pro-crypto people struggle with this because they can’t even articulate a clear value proposition for crypto? Is it a currency? A store of value?

As a slight crypto skeptic, I can accept that Bitcoin might have value as something of a store of value, although in practice it trades more like a speculative tech stock. So advocates struggle to make that argument. Notably, Bitcoin is certainly not acting like an inflation hedge in our current high inflation environment.

So maybe there isn’t a purpose? And while that might be a good argument for a full ban, I could also accept just regulating it the way we do beanie babies trading. I.e., not at all.

When second amendment advocates tell us that they would be willing to die to defend their right to gun ownership—through violent application of their guns—we should believe them.

Ideally, we’d court controversy with Republicans rather than the left flank of our coalition.

I do challenge the disappointment with Democratic administrations. Obama did great things for our progressive policies goals. Notably the ACA, which fundamentally changed healthcare and insurance in the US. Biden just passed the IRA; a massive climate bill that makes a massive investment in green energy. Further, the US provided the largest and most generous pandemic financial aid through a series of bills that include the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.

I think the comparison with other countries—chiefly Western European countries with strong welfare states—is counterproductive because the US voters are quite different. As much as it sucks to admit, American voters are just quite small-c conservative when compared to other rich, developed countries. 

In my opinion, that creates a fundamental constraint on what we can accomplish in the short and medium term. Hence, the embracement of popularism is our best strategy to implement progressive policies given the voters we have to court. (And the geographical advantage that Republicans have in the electoral college only exacerbate the challenge.)"

For example, these AI programs commonly make factual errors, and the student’s assignment could be to correct these errors. The AI could even be biased to introduce more errors or create errors of a specific type. 

The student would take the role of an editor rather than an author. They would still need to use conventional learning materials like books and lectures to gain enough familiarity with the subject. Students could also probe the AI with different prompts and questions to see the contours of its understanding.

And if the student completes this work in an assigned AI program then there is a history of the work they performed, which the teacher can use in grading.

Thompson argues that it is counterproductive to resist AI, particularly because students may just cheat using AI if given conventional assignments. Further, such generative AI may become a commonplace tool and therefore students should learn familiarity with it early. He gives the comparison to the electronic calculator, which removed much of the drudgery of manually performing math.

Similarly, the rote effort of constructing essays may be supplanted by generative AI that does the low level work of optimizing sentences and paragraphs, while also making use of its larger memory for referencing knowledge. The user instead handles the higher level of tasks of creating the problem statement and they then serve as an editor to correct mistakes.

And I personally blame Democratic leadership—Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer—for this fiasco. Everyone wants to blame Manchin, but I think leadership needs to recognize the political constraints they face (including Manchin’s views) and prioritize policies within those constraints. That is the job of being in a leadership role; making the hard calls that can build a voting block to pass legislation and receiving political flack for their decisions.

Although at the time I recognized the challenge faced by leadership with their razor congressional margins and their diverse coalition containing multiple constituencies, each with their own pet projects. I can understand their concerns about having to anger some political blocks, journalists, and twitterati “thought leaders” by explicitly endorsing certain priorities over others. E.g., stating they want to drop child care programs in favor of continuing the CTC. No matter what they choose they will anger someone and receive a fair amount of loud condemnation."

Ben Thompson has written extensively on the power of these companies in his Aggregation Theory, https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/

Google, Facebook, and other aggregators are powerful because they **control demand**. In contrast, traditional information businesses are all about supply. For example, a regional newspaper has a geographical monopoly because they have invested in printing and physical distribution infrastructure for that area. Similarly, cable companies have monopolies in owning the physical wires that distribute their content.

The internet fundamentally changed that because
> Zero distribution costs. Zero marginal costs. Zero transactions. This is what the Internet enables, and it is completely transforming not just technology companies but companies in every single industry. Old moats are gone — and new ones can be built — and Aggregation Theory helps you identify both.

Thompson has written numerous articles over the years about how these internet companies have disrupted various businesses and society at large. For the SB audience, I’d particularly recommend his Mar 2016 article, “The Voters Decide”, https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/

In that article he references a contemporary NYT piece about how party leadership has lost control over candidate selection. In that 2016 election, both Trump and Sanders—like Obama before them—were able to leverage internet platforms to sidestep party elites and go straight to the voters with their novel messages. Thompson applies Aggregation Theory to explore the mechanisms by which internet platforms disrupted politics.

> This is a big problem for the parties as described in The Party Decides. Remember, in Noel and company’s description party actors care more about their policy preferences than they do voter preferences, but in an aggregated world it is voters aka users who decide which issues get traction and which don’t. And, by extension, the most successful politicians in an aggregated world are not those who serve the party but rather those who tell voters what they most want to hear."

The Substack founders even listed his Stratechery publication as inspiration for their business. [1]  Thompsons wrote about Slow Boring in his 2021 article, “Sovereign Writers and Substack”. [2]

> Substack Pro made it possible for Yglesias to launch Slow Boring without worrying about paying the bills, and is making a profit as a reward for bearing the risk of Yglesias not succeeding or succeeding more slowly than he needed. As for Yglesias, he may end up missing out on several hundred thousand dollars this year, but given he’s not selling a book but rather a subscription he can look forward to a huge increase in revenue next year.

In that article, Thompsons defends Substack Pro, where Substack offers writers a guaranteed income for the first year, while capping their upside. Substack was getting a lot of criticism for offering this arrangement to controversial writers (e.g., Andrew Sullivan) and they were accused of not just platforming, but also funding the promulgation of these views. Thompson suggests that Substack Pro is comparable to a book advance and generally works to the authors disadvantage since Substack captures all of the upside.

Thompson’s article provides some great insight into Substack’s business model and the risks it prevents to traditional publications. He again references Slow Boring when explaining how Substack allows for unbundling such that the highest value authors can directly capture their value.

> Still, that doesn’t change the fact there is a real unfair deal in publishing, and it has nothing to do with Substack. Go back to Yglesias: while I don’t know what he was paid by Vox (it turns out that Substack, thanks to their leaderboards, is actually far more transparent about writers’ income than nearly anywhere else), I’m guessing it was a lot less than the $380,000 he is on pace for, much less the $775,000 he would earn had he forgone an advance. It was Vox, in other words, that was taking advantage of Yglesias.

And I think that leads to errors of political judgment.

I think these critics fundamentally fail to appreciate the dynamics of business, particularly the extent to which they are constantly addressing challenges and thereby changing. They instead see a firm as a static entity that some people have gained control over, likely for unjust reasons. That may be because such a static and statist mental model is appropriate for the institutions that house these critiques; e.g., universities.

Consider the juggernaut Amazon; a common target of these critics. They see it as a massive and powerful institution that Jeff Bezos just happened to have gained control over. (Before he recently stepped out of the CEO role.)

The critics don’t recognize how this crazy and driven person quit his lucrative hedge fund VP job to sell books out of his garage. They aren’t aware of how this weirdo embraced his new, lesser role, including packing boxes and hand delivering them to the post office. The denigrators fail to see the extent to which Bezos had to learn this business from scratch and in the process create a new and revolutionary business model. And because he was crazy enough—some might say irrational enough—to start selling books out of his garage, Bezos now owns about 10% of AMZN. Hence why he is incredibly wealthy and why he had control over this massive and powerful company.

The critics just don’t have a correct mental model of business and therefore can’t make sense of any of this."

AWS did all the hard work of managing the underlying hardware and software that facilitated that.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud was also launched at the same time and does share some similarities to time timesharing. You could already rent shared servers from many vendors for a while. E.g., I rented a shared Apache server in the 90s. EC2 was different in that they offered far more fine grained billing—initially by the hour and now by the second—whereas other vendors required at least monthly commitments. Further,  you spin up (or down) an instance with an API call so that it could be fully automated. And again AWS managed all the auxiliary stuff that facilitated it.

S3 and EC2 were revolutionary at the time of their debut due to their fine grained, usage-based billing and AWS managing everything behind the scenes. These attributes are what distinguish cloud computing from conventional server leasing, including timesharing on shared instances."

I’m just not sure I buy that.

I think the current inflation concern is high nominal wage growth that could keep driving inflation. The hope is that higher interest rates can cool the labor market without causing a substantial increase in unemployment. As Jason Furman explains, [1]

> The pace of nominal wage or compensation growth over the last six months is generally consistent with about a 4.5 percent inflation rate. … Moreover, the growth of labor costs has largely tracked price growth, so there is little reason to believe that business margin compression will meaningfully lower inflation without a slowdown in compensation growth or that real wages will easily return to their previous trajectory.

> Will the labor market continue to loosen on its own without much of an increase in unemployment? How quickly will wage growth slow? And, how much will slower wage growth translate into slower price growth? Given the magnitude of the issues, it is unlikely that we will see inflation much below 3.5 percent in 2023.

For context, Furman is Harvard econ prof and  a prominent Democratic econ advisor from the Obama administration. I think he's had the most clear and honest analysis of the economic factors of the pandemic and the recovery. While he initially believed inflation would be transitory and downplayed the risks, he changed his mind as new data piled up demonstrating the risk of persistent inflation.

We even explicitly allow and encourage them to use calculators so that they can focus on higher level skills.

Similarly, with generative AI it may no longer make sense to assign conventional essays. The temptations to cheat are just too great. Further, writers and other creative professionals will be using these tools and students should learn familiarity with them in preparation for their future careers.

As a historical example, in the 90s, my middle school taught us all how to use Microsoft Word and assumed many of us would use it writing essays. We made fewer spelling errors than previous cohorts of students due to spellcheck and it therefore didn’t make sense to grade heavily on that dimension. Modern word processors include more advanced assistance in identifying grammar errors, and that should also impact grading. (I’m writing this comment in Google Doc, and it already corrected multiple such mistakes that would’ve otherwise annoyed readers greatly.)

I’m not sure how exactly education will need to adapt to generative AI and just shared one idea. Yet I am convinced it will have to adapt to not only minimize cheating but to also prepare students for professional work.

> As the CEO of an automaker, managing relationships with suppliers is a crucial part of ensuring the success of your business. Strong relationships with suppliers can lead to improved quality, increased efficiency, and better overall performance. Here are a few tips for managing relationships with suppliers:
>
> 1. Communicate openly and honestly: It's important to establish open and honest communication with your suppliers. This means being transparent about your expectations and needs, as well as any potential challenges or concerns. By doing so, you can build trust and foster a sense of collaboration, which can help to improve the overall relationship.
> 2. Show appreciation for their work: Acknowledge and appreciate the work that your suppliers do. This can be as simple as thanking them for their efforts, or recognizing their contributions in a more formal way. By showing appreciation, you can motivate your suppliers to continue delivering high-quality products and services.
> 3. Be responsive and reliable: As the CEO of an automaker, it's important to be responsive and reliable when it comes to working with your suppliers. This means being available to answer questions and address concerns in a timely manner. It also means being consistent in your communication and following through on any promises or commitments you make.
> 4. Foster a culture of collaboration: Encourage a culture of collaboration within your company, and make it a priority to work closely with your suppliers. This can include regular meetings, joint brainstorming sessions, and other opportunities for collaboration. By fostering a collaborative culture, you can improve communication and alignment, which can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.
> 5. Establish clear contracts and expectations: Clearly define the terms of your relationship with your suppliers in a written contract. This should include expectations for delivery times, quality standards, and other key aspects of the relationship. By establishing clear contracts and expectations, you can avoid misunderstandings and ensure that both parties are on the same page.

Seems pretty generic, but reasonable. I guess it would be more useful if the prompt included specific challenges the hypothetical automaker was facing with suppliers.

I think the certification function is essential to the continuing durability of universities. Some professions, like law and medicine, have a hard requirement on credentials from accredited institutions. Other professions still use degrees as an initial filter in finding candidates with relevant knowledge and some demonstrated ability; even just demonstration of the diligence and conscientiousness necessary to complete four years of assigned coursework.

I think the tech industry is the exception that proves the rule. First, in the dotcom boom and subsequent resurrection, there just were not sufficient computer-science/engineering graduates to meet the labor demand. Second, even as enrollment boomed, degrees never became a sufficient, nor even necessary, mark of certification. There’s a lot of contention among tech workers (including myself) about why degrees have failed to fill this certification role, but we all generally accept that as fact. Even Stanford CS grads are put through the gauntlet, and a non-trivial portion of them are rejected.

Hence, the tech industry has developed rigorous interview screening criteria to judge abilities and has a tradition of hiring people from a diverse range of backgrounds. The lack of formal certification has led to a boom in vocation tech schools (i.e., coding bootcamps) that promise students lucrative tech careers with as little as three months of training. I’ve worked with numerous software engineers and data scientists with excellent capabilities who came from these programs. But I also have rejected a higher portion of candidates from these university alternatives in conducting roughly 1000 interviews.

The “disruption” of education for tech work has led many to believe that the bootcamp model can be generalized to other industries. But the proponents of that vision fail to account for why this has succeeded in tech; the lack of formal certification. We in the industry would greatly appreciate such certification—it would save a ton of time and money on interviewing—but we’ve so far failed to create one.

Other industries that are satisfied with existing university certification are not going to be eager to invent their own in-house aptitude tests nor trust some alternative certification. Hence, I think universities are not at risk of disruption due their value as certifiers."

I agree that an in-person instructor provides some value in the form of motivation, but I’d challenge the analogy to a personal trainer. A personal trainer provides far more personalized coaching, including adapting to the specific strengths and weaknesses of their trainee. They can also design training around exercises and activities that the trainee particularly enjoys (or at least hates less.)

While a teacher or professor can provide some personalized support, say feedback in grading an assignment, they lack the time to provide the same level of one-on-one instruction as a personal trainer. Further, they lack flexibility in adapting course work since they are teaching an entire class of students.

Therefore I see an opportunity for more personalized education, and AI (or software in general) might one day capitalize on that. Not only could coursework be adapted to the specific strengths and weaknesses of each individual student, the material could be presented to appeal to each student’s interests. That could help address the motivation issue by including content that is genuinely interesting to each student. For example, a student who is obsessed with Minecraft could be given math problems in the context of solving common in-game challenges that a player could encounter.

I’m not particularly excited about such tech-in-education opportunities because, as the article points out, tech has repeatedly failed to disrupt education. I just recognize the potential for far greater personalized education and one day tech might offer a scalable solution."

Yet even the most mundane work requires familiarity with rudimental data structures and algorithms. I’ve been surprised that many CS grads, including at times those from prestigious programs, and even occasionally experienced engineers, cannot demonstrate such basic competencies.

For example, I commonly used the following exercise as an effective quick screen.

> You have a file on your laptop, how would you count the number of unique lines in it?

To provide context for non-engineers, one needn’t even write code to solve that exercise. You can just type a command into a terminal and get the answer. The strongest candidates immediately provided that solution. The weakest candidates struggled even with the concept of a file.

Even a coding solution to this problem is extremely simple, taking 1-10 lines of code in mainstream programming languages. Most candidates could eventually describe a solution, but many couldn’t. In contrast, the strongest candidates immediately followed their command-line solution with something like the following,

> I would iterate through the lines of the file, add each line to a hashtable (i.e., set), and the final length of that collection in the answer

The reference data structure, the hashtable, is one of the most ubiquitous and foundational data structures in CS. All intro algo/DS courses teach it and test it. And subsequent student projects over multiple courses will commonly use a hashtable. By the time of graduation it should be second nature.

Yet a frighteningly high fraction (~10%) of CS grads couldn’t even solve this simple exercise even after I explicitly told them to use a hashtable. Some didn’t even know what it was! I imagine some of this adverse selection in interviewing (i.e., a market for lemons), where the weakest candidates are constantly interviewing, while the strongest get an offer directly from internships.

Apologies for the long rant. I just find it deeply frustrating that any CS program could confer a degree to these candidates. And hence the need for tech companies to develop rigorous (and time consuming) aptitude screening."

When I had a personal trainer, he frequently asked questions about excitement, energy level, and other things related to motivation. He would adapt a routine in real time and also planned out a workout schedule with a balance between stuff I loved and other stuff I found frustrating.

I imagine a light touch is needed for low-motivation trainees, particularly if they’re just getting into exercising. Just pre-purchasing a dozen $160/hr sessions probably provides value in commitment for some.

From Bloomberg’s in Feb 2022 , “Tesla, Who? Biden Can't Bring Himself to Say It — and Musk Has Noticed” [1]

> At every opportunity, Biden hails progress Ford and GM have made toward fielding an electric fleet. But his ongoing and obvious snubs of Tesla -- a source of mild intrigue within the administration -- have sparked increasingly exasperated public reactions from Musk
> Last fall, after a White House event promoting electric vehicles that excluded Tesla, Musk said Biden is “biased” against the company and said his administration “seems to be controlled by unions.”  

At the time, I was frustrated with Biden for potentially compromising the EV transition in some anachronistic attempt to appear pro-union. I thought that Biden should’ve embraced and championed Tesla as an example of American innovation that was accelerating our green transition. There could still be room for legacy American automakers as they attempt to catch up through their own belated innovations.

Certainly doesn’t justify Elon's spiral into right-wing insanity. Further, he’s now also jeopardizing the transition to EVs by both distracting himself with Twitter and making Tesla a politically polarizing company. E.g., a MAGA hat on wheels.

I would argue the directionality is backwards. They aren’t reasoning themselves into believing rage is the appropriate political strategy but instead feeling rage and creating a post hoc justification for expressing that feeling.

This is me once again shilling Haidt’s theories from “The Righteous Mind.” Intuition and emotions come first and then reasoning is used to construct a socially acceptable narrative that validates the feelings and resulting behavior. And that applies to all of us, myself included.

The best we can hope for is to accept and explore our feelings. We can then inspect our current justifying narratives and see if any aspect seems inconsistent with our values or our factual understanding. That is actually useful for creating more cogent justifications, although at times we’ll find contradictions. Working through those dilemmas, particularly discussing them with respected interlocutors, can slowly change our intuitions."

There was accountability for the banks in the form of Dodd-Frank regulations. The banks certainly viewed that as their punishment for taking dangerous financial risks. Those regulations constrained risk taking and therefore reduced bank return-on-equity; i.e., made the banks less profitable. That is a good thing for society since banks proved unable to responsibly manage risk due to free market forces alone.

Hard to hold anyone individually accountable, because as you pointed out, no one was breaking the law. There was also a lot of reputational damage for politicians and experts who championed financial deregulation. A lot of that was criticism sloppy applied—e.g., a focus on the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagal—sloppiness that was demonstrated because we didn’t reinstate old regulations but instead created new ones."

For example, the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 had good intentions as summarized on Wikipedia, [1]

> This legislation established an ""affordable housing"" loan purchase mandate for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that mandate was to be regulated by HUD. Initially, the 1992 legislation required that 30% or more of Fannie's and Freddie's loan purchases be related to ""affordable housing"" (borrowers who were below normal lending standards). However, HUD was given the power to set future requirements, and HUD soon increased the mandates. This encouraged ""subprime"" mortgages. (See HUD Mandates, below.)

Yet that legislation combined with numerous other decisions—decisions made by both private and public actors—to create the subprime mortgage crisis. Still, no one was knowingly acting in bad faith in all of the major events leading to the subprime crisis.

Yes, many bad decisions were made, chiefly the extension of credit to subprime borrowers. Those lending decisions were not crimes but instead bipartisan policy aims to extend homeownership. And yes, there were a few isolated instances of actual fraud related to subprime lending. Those were prosecuted. Yet these crimes did not contribute to the subprime financial crisis.

Instead, it was the broad issuance of credit to borrowers who were at high risk of default that caused the subprime financial crisis. Further, the financial industry failed to update their modeling of mortgage default risk to account for the new, lower lending standards.

I did appreciate that most of the episode focused on Sinema’s unexplainable actions rather than any specific bad takes. They provided a good recap on why so many of us are frustrated with her. Particularly, Sinema’s failure to explain her unpopular positions, including

* Why is she opposed to medicare negotiating drug prices?
* Why does she support the carried interest tax loophole?

While there are arguments for those positions, although generally not arguments made by Democrats, Sinema doesn't offer any argument. In many ways that is more frustrating than having weak or incorrect justification.

I would’ve appreciated some speculation on why Sinema has adopted these specific unpopular positions, and why she doesn’t defend them. Maybe there are even some rumors from congressional staff and acquaintances that could suggest her rationale.

Twitter has plenty of conspiracy theories for Sinema’s actions, but I don’t find any of it convincing. E.g., maybe some billionaires are promising her a rich payoff after her political career. The reality is likely more boring; like maybe Sinema genuinely holds some heterodox views. I just can’t understand why she doesn’t attempt to defend her unpopular stances. "

But in the depths of the financial meltdown, there just wasn’t any mechanism to do so. The government lacked authority to nationalize the banks and if they wanted the banks to cooperate, then the government had to offer favorable terms.

And things moved fast! Lehman collapsed on Sept 15th and within weeks the SP500 dropped 20%. Worse, the money market funding used by all corporations was drying up as lenders feared the worst. Reputable non-financial firms, including John Deer and Coca Cola, were concerned they wouldn’t be able to make Sept. end-of-month payroll because their short-term funding was at risk of being withdrawn. TARP was quickly put together and passed on Oct 3rd, and the major bank bailouts were completed by the end of October. 

Further, Paulson, Berneke, Geithner, and other gov leaders recognized they couldn’t just help weak banks. Doing so would single those banks out and cause their counterparties to withdraw assets. Instead, they needed all major banks to accept some TARP funds, even if some banks didn’t need them. So TARP funding was structured on particularly favorable terms.

The collapse of Lehman is insightful to what could’ve happened. Paulson tried to engineer some acquisitions, but CEO Dick Fuld kept pushing acquirers for better terms. He waited too long and eventually only Barclays was still at the table.. Fuld reluctantly agreed to rough terms, but the British government blocked the deal; and for good reasons.

Many more vulnerable banks would’ve gone the way of Lehman if the Federal Gov attempted to push harsh terms for accepting TARP."

Financing stock buybacks with newly issued debt it totally reasonable way to restructure a firm's capital structure; i.e., its mix of equity and debt financing. Some firms, particularly asset heavy firms like real estate, should use a fair amount of debt financing since they can issue secured bonds with their assets as collateral. Fixed income investment investors value the opportunity for relatively safe bonds and stockholders get better return on equity by using less of it for financing.

When financial conditions change and a firm’s capital structure becomes imbalanced then that should be corrected. At times they’ll repurchase stock with newly issued debt. Conversely, they can issue new shares and use the proceeds to retire debt at other times. Overall, both equity and fixed income investors prefer the regularly optimized capital structure."

Doing nothing may also be a good idea. Joe Weisenthal (and others) have suggested that the lack of crypto regulation has limited institutional investment in crypto and that is good. [1] Particularly, no important institutional investors have suffered significant losses in the current crypto meltdown. In contrast, had regulation enabled greater institutional investment, then the broader financial market could’ve gone into a crisis similar to how the subprime mortgage meltdown triggered a broader financial crisis.

Crypto might even be a good outlet for the most reckless financial speculators as long as it remains isolated from our broader financial markets. These gamblers can trade amongst each other, and when their house of cards collapses there will be no collateral damage. That is superior to having these irresponsible traders participating in markets that actually matter and thereby exacerbating bubbles and busts.

However, prior to the release of Bitcoin, Back disappeared during 2009 and 2010, which coincided with Satoshi’s Bitcoin development period. What is more interesting, after Satoshi left, Back appeared again on the bitcointalk.org forum

> Since the creation of Bitcoin, Adam Back has been strongly supporting the currency. Being very passionate about BTC, Back has made incredible price predictions several times. In 2020, he stated that BTC was likely to reach up to $300,000 in a 5-year perspective, even without institutional investors’ support. In addition, Back believes that in the future, people will realize that Bitcoin helps protect from inflation as governments keep printing money.

> Federal prosecutors have shelved a criminal investigation of Angelo R. Mozilo after determining that his actions in the mortgage meltdown — which led to $67.5-million settlement against him — did not amount to criminal wrongdoing.

He was charged by the SEC with securities fraud under civil law, but that was not fraud in issuing subprime mortgages. [2] It was instead fraud for lying to the shareholders of Countrywide Financial about the risks of their mortgage business. Mozilo did that so that he could sell his shares at a high stock price and thereby his settlement also included insider trading charges.

Again, plenty of horrible decisions were made in the events leading to the subprime crisis, but none of the major actions were crimes. When there were allegations of fraud, it was investigated. In the case of Mozilo, the SEC was able to force him into a massive settlement under the less stringent criteria of civil law. There unfortunately wasn’t sufficient evidence to also bring criminal charges because that requires a far higher burden of proof.

That is the type of misinformation that erodes trust in institutions. It implies that our government is corrupt and conspires with the rich and powerful to allow them to escape justice. When in actuality our government is quite effective and sophisticated at administering justice.

In cases where unethical corporation actions go unpunished, it is generally because those actions were carried out under the counsel of similarly sophisticated private lawyers. Our’s is a system of laws and those laws are imperfect. At times actors will exploit that.

While we can be disgusted with their actions, we should not recognize it as a failure to enforce the law. Instead, we should identify the inadequacies of current laws and regulations, and then fix them.

You need a driver's license, car registration, and insurance to drive. In a narrow framing, that is a restriction of privacy and freedom. Yet these restrictions are necessary because cars are dangerous. We want to ensure that cars are used responsibly so therefore the privilege of driving requires these restrictions, including documentation of ownership and active driver certification. One can always walk or take the bus if they find these restrictions overly invasive.

Similarly, the modern finance system is incredibly powerful. Anyone can move arbitrarily large amounts of money with trivial effort, yet solid guarantees of security and fidelity. Even at a small scale, electronic funds transfers can greatly facilitate crimes. E.g., selling child pornography over the internet with electronic payments. Therefore we have instituted numerous regulations and restrictions around banking, including KYC/AML. One can always use cash if they find these restrictions overly invasive.

Regulations also include strong protections against misuse of KYC/AML information by either financial institutions or the government. That includes narrow access controls and permanent audit records of all access as well as criminal penalties for misuse. This is similar to how a police officer can be charged with a crime if they attempt to misuse DMV records. Our government is therefore guarding the privacy of individuals who comply with its regulations because that is recognized as important."

I’m starting to see how others view Taibbi, Greenwald, and compatriots as something like anti-establishment leftists.

Further, they put populism first and are therefore particularly suspicious of institutions and authority based around technocratic expertises. That would include not only the CDC, FDA, and the Federal Reserve, but also reputable journalism with an institutional claim to authoritative reporting.

Therefore these populist leftists have identified Democrat-aligned institutions as their chief adversaries. Further, they find comfort among MAGA Republicans now that that party has abandoned any respect for institutions and expertise.

From my perspective, Taibbi and Greenwald are acting as if they were partisan Republicans by solely attacking Democrats and our aligned institutions. Yet I can see how others would find that a poor classification since these left populist would, in theory, eagerly attack a Romeny Republican party that wielded authoritative institutional power comparable to Democrats.

For example, if you’re shipping oil, then you also need to pay shipping costs, including insurance. If your trade and finance currencies are different, then you also need to hedge the risk of that currency pair moving against you, which adds cost

Notably, the US dollar has the largest and deepest funding markets. Depth in this context implies a diverse pool of counterparties willing to take the other side of any trade. That minimizes deadweight loss since there are more competitors that you can choose from, which improves pricing efficiency. If you’re looking for investors to finance your oil production infrastructure, you’ll get the lowest cost of capital by using dollar funding.

With dollar liabilities, you now want dollar revenue rather than hedging that foreign exchange.

When we advocate for building homeless shelters and low-income housing, we should be clear that only the downtrodden will be occupying those structures. We will not be warehousing problematic people in one’s neighborhood. Insead, these individuals will be institutionalized in specialized medical facilities. At worst, we’ll create low-security prisons, far-removed from cities, if medical institutionalization is inappropriate for some.

But we need to explicitly recognize the negative externalities of these problematic homeless and use language that clearly separates them from the simply downtrodden. We also need to take actions to demonstrate our commitment to addressing these externalities, even if a few gadflys criticize that as cruel.

The hope is that higher interest rates can cool the labor market without causing a substantial increase in unemployment. As Jason Furman explains, [1]

> The pace of nominal wage or compensation growth over the last six months is generally consistent with about a 4.5 percent inflation rate. … Moreover, the growth of labor costs has largely tracked price growth, so there is little reason to believe that business margin compression will meaningfully lower inflation without a slowdown in compensation growth or that real wages will easily return to their previous trajectory.

> Will the labor market continue to loosen on its own without much of an increase in unemployment? How quickly will wage growth slow? And, how much will slower wage growth translate into slower price growth? Given the magnitude of the issues, it is unlikely that we will see inflation much below 3.5 percent in 2023.

For context, Furman is a Harvard econ prof and a prominent Democratic econ advisor from the Obama administration. I think he's had the most clear and honest analysis of the economic factors of the pandemic and the recovery. While he initially believed inflation would be transitory and downplayed the risks, he has changed his mind as new data piled up demonstrating the risk of persistent inflation.

[1]

> I want to believe that there is still a path to “immaculate disinflation”, with job market churn fading in the context of rising employment and rising living standards for all. But it is getting harder to see how it happens. Tolerating persistent inflation of 4-5% may be a bitter pill for many policymakers, but may be better than many of the alternatives. At least right now most people still have jobs and real consumer spending is still rising on trend.

Since that is a paid-only post, I won’t quote it at length. I’ll simply note that Klein provides a rigorous overview of how nominal wage growth can drive inflation. Notably, this not only increases the cost of services—which are a larger component of US consumer spending than goods—but this also provides consumers with the means to continue bidding up the costs of scarce goods and services. This is not necessarily the doom loop of accelerating inflation in a wage-price spiral, but instead simply persistent inflation that becomes increasingly entrenched in the expectations of businesses and consumers.

Klein also draws attention to a hawkish-language pivot from the Fed’s chief dove, Vice Chair Lael Brainard. From her Nov 28th speech on monetary policy in the face of supply shocks, [2]

> Even when each individual supply shock fades over time and behaves like a temporary shock on its own, a drawn-out sequence of adverse supply shocks that has the cumulative effect of constraining potential output for an extended period is likely to call for monetary policy tightening to restore balance between demand and supply.
> In addition, a protracted series of supply shocks associated with an extended period of high inflation—as with the pandemic and the war—risks pushing the inflation expectations of households and businesses above levels consistent with the central bank's long-run inflation objective. It is vital for monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored, because inflation expectations shape the behavior of households, businesses, and workers and enter directly into the inflation process.
> Even in the presence of pandemics and wars, central bankers have the responsibility to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with our target.

With Brainard embracing hawkish policy in the face of a supply-constrained economy, which would include labor shortages, I’m starting to share Klein’s concern that we won’t be able to get inflation under control without a bit of pain in the labor market. I.e., we need to decrease labor demand by contracting economic activity through restrictive monetary policy. A recession seems increasingly likely, and hopefully it will be short and shallow.

Again, everyone is monitoring the labor market because it’s the largest market that is currently out of balance. Core inflation will run at 4-6% at these rates of nominal wage growth due to the flow through of labor costs into services as well as the continued increase in nominal purchasing power.

And yes, part of that is, as you point, the Fed signaling their commitment to taming inflation even at the cost of higher unemployment. Nonetheless, everyone knows we can’t get back on trend inflation until the labor market normalizes.

> But _my_ reason to worry about excess tightening by the Fed is based on TIPS and seeing inflation falling. Nothing to do with the labor market.

Searching for relevant precedent, I found an article on “Alcohol Advertising” from the Free Speech Center. [1]

> Due to the commercial speech doctrine developed by the Supreme Court, state regulations of alcohol advertising are subject to careful review. Commercial speech is generally defined as speech designed to convince a target audience to purchase a good or service so that a business or individual can make a profit. The Court first explicitly ruled that truthful commercial speech was protected by the First Amendment in Virginia Pharmacy v. Virginia Consumer Council (1976).

The article goes on to lists several cases where courts have struck down alcohol advertising restrictions at the state and federal level, and then mentions some limited cases where regulations were allowed to stand.

> Regardless, some courts have allowed cities to ban alcohol and cigarette advertising on billboards, which are easily viewed by minors, implicitly accepting city arguments that such advertising increased alcohol consumption and that their regulation was narrowly drawn to advance a compelling government interest. See Anheuser-Busch v. Schmoke (4th Cir. 1996).

In contrast, I believe tobacco marketing was restricted by the Master Settlement Agreement between tobacco companies and 46 states. As explained on Wikipedia, [2]

> The states settled their Medicaid lawsuits against the tobacco industry for recovery of their tobacco-related health-care costs.  In exchange, the companies agreed to curtail or cease certain tobacco marketing practices…

Therefore it might not be possible to regulate alcohol/marijuana marketing to the same extent as tobacco.

I actually used to be rather in favor of state interventions to promote public health and general social wellbeing. Then the state came for something I valued, my e-cig. First San Francisco, and then California, increasingly banned e-cig products that I enjoyed (e.g. the flavor ban). Probably played a major role in my decision to move back to Georgia. And now the federal government has banned the mail delivery of these products and there appears to be interest in going further.

I understand the desire to promote public health, particularly to protect children, but I still believe that we have to give adults a fair amount of latitude to live their lives as they want; even at the expense of their own health and wellbeing. To me, this freedom just feels deeply tied into human dignity and autonomy. Further, to not be a hypocrite, I want to extend this freedom to vices that I abhor. E.g., sugary processed foods and gambling.

That does introduce something of contradiction with my belief that the state should provide healthcare to everyone. After all, if the state has to pay for our healthcare, does it not have a vested interest in promoting healthy habits and restricting unhealthy products even if only to control costs? I’m not sure how to resolve that contradiction, but I’m open to some libertarian-esque compromises such as allowing individuals to opt out of some future benefits (but not the taxes) in exchange for the freedom to wreck their own health.

And there are extensions to non-health areas such as how gambling can ruin peoples financial wellbeing. Not sure how to resolve the contradiction between that and a strong social safety net, but again, maybe there is some libertarian-like compromise.

I just deeply believe that adults should be given a fair amount of freedom to live their life as they want, particularly if the costs of their bad decisions can be internalized. And the more I reflect on this value, the more some libertarian BS starts to look reasonable to me."

And yes, I agree that the state has a valid interest in minimizing externalities. I’m just arguing that that interest has to be weighed against the importances human dignity and individual autonomy. Hence, I think we should work towards approaches that internalize the costs of suboptimal behavior on the individual practicing it rather than broad restrictions on choices available to individuals.

Your example of drunk driving is a case where we can’t internalize the cost of the behavior and outlawing that is appropriate. Other costs associated with drinking and other unhealthy behavior can be internalized so restrictions may not be warranted. It is a judgment call to determine where specifically to draw the line when there is a mix of internal and external costs."

Jonathan Haidt provides a good description of the negativity bias and how to manage that through mindfulness in his book, “The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom.” Been a while since I read it (I should re-read it), and reviewing my notes now I find some useful tidbits.

> Responses to threats and unpleasantness are faster, stronger, and harder to inhibit than responses to opportunities and pleasures.
> Depressed people are caught in a feedback loop in which distorted thoughts cause negative feelings, which then distort thinking further.
> As Buddha said: “""When a man knows the solitude of silence, and feels the joy of quietness, he is then free from fear and sin.”

I found this book helpful in understanding the significance of subconscious thought and emotions in shaping our perception of the world. Particularly, learning that a lot of our rational thought is just narrative building around our initial intuitions. Simply reading through the research presented in the book makes it easier to accept that you can’t force yourself into feeling a specific way nor eliminate a biased perception of reality. Similarly, learning the research on the benefits of mindfulness motivates practicing that.

Rather than fight emotions, I recall that Haidt recommends a gentler approach of recognizing feelings without judgment and then exploring the narratives that our rational mind is building around those subconscious intuitions.  Once the feelings are accepted it becomes easier to recognize our rational mind’s attempt to construct a story that justifies them. One can play with that narrative and also gently challenge some of its components. That allows us to introduce some aspects of positivity, and as the rational mind ponders the revised narrative, our emotions can slowly move a bit in that direction.

I strongly recommend reading the “The Happiness Hypothesis” and incorporating some of Haidt’s recommendations into your thinking.   "

Yet I find that to be a narrow reading of the article, which is clearly a mourning of the collapse of the New Deal coalition and its replacement by the Third Way centrism marked by the election of Clinton in 1992. Laura and Matt do engage with that a bit towards the end of the episode, and they agree that it is unfortunate that Democrats have been losing working class voters, possibly due to culture war issues and a reduced focus on economic populism.

Frank’s article mirrors a criticism of Democrats that I’ve commonly seen from the economic populist left (i.e., Sanders supports) in which Democrats are castigated for embracing the highly-educated professional class at the expense of the working class. In the more conspiratorial tellings, this condemnation alleges that the Democratic party has been captured by the rich so that liberal proclivities could be redirected from redistributional economics onto identity and cultural issues. A more reasonable narrative is that these highly-educated professionals have a mix of liberal policy priorities that include both redistribution economics and civil rights issues.

I think this genre of criticism is most fair when focused on the disproportionately large impact that highly-educated professionals have on setting the policy priorities and messaging of the Democratic party. As Matt has pointed out before in multiple Slow Boring articles, the Democratic party is strongly influenced by staffers and activists that are quite far to the left of the median Democratic voter, particularly on cultural issues and in their usage of esoteric academic language.

Further, there may also be some truth to the assertion that the courting of affluent professionals has muted Democrats' focus on practical economic redistribution. While there is plenty of desire to tax the rich, the income line delineating rich keeps rising, currently sitting at $400k/year. In practice, you can’t build a robust welfare state with taxes only focused on such a small group of taxpayers. There is a lot of income, financing a lot of private consumption, within the upper middle class, and we’ll need to significantly increase taxes on that income band in order to redirect resources from private consumption into public services. A strong welfare state entails the reallocation of tangible resources (chiefly labor) and our taxes need to be structured accordingly.

So I do think there is something to Frank’s broader argument, but I’m not sure what, if any, practical steps Democratic politicians could take to embrace economic populism and win back the working class. There is a reason the New Deal coalition collapsed; chiefly the Republican’s Southern strategy to win the white working class as Democrats fought for civil rights. Some have suggested that Democrats should focus solely on economic issues, but that ignores the very real interest in civil rights and cultural issues among many Democratic voters. Should some politicians ignore that, others will fill the void. For example, Clinton’s embrace of identity issues in the 2016 primary election to outflank Sanders."

I think it’s important to mention Canada having this problem despite it also being a “nation of immigrants.” The semi-sovereign province of Quebec does conceptualize itself as distinct from the rest of Canada due to its history of being settled by the French.

Additionally, the province of Alberta also just recently challenged Canadian federal laws with the passage of their Alberta Sovereignty Act in Nov 2022. [1] That is further straining Canadian national unity.

I particularly like his framing of crypto as a “toy financial system.” In some ways it is a cleaner and purer system in that it isn’t restrained by centuries of financial regulation, bureaucracy, and legacy technology. A sort of an idealized model of a financial system.

Over time it developed many of the same components of the traditional financial system such as exchanges, derivatives, hedge funds, etc. But crypto never developed any substantial connection to the actual economy and the real world; it was never used to finance any real production. Levine contrasts that to the real financial system,

> The regular financial system is built up from things in the real world, things that have some practical value and produce some reliable cash flows. A synthetic collateralized debt obligation of mortgage-backed securities is a very abstract bit of financial engineering, but it is the output of a complicated machine, and the inputs to the machine are people who live in houses sending monthly checks to pay for those houses. There’s a lot of math and judgment involved in structuring and pricing the thing, but there is also a house. The value of a synthetic CDO tranche can go to zero, but the value of all the stuff that goes into the machine can’t go to zero as long as people need houses.

Crypto never developed anything like that and therefore the financial value assigned to crypto assets was never based on any real economic activity nor hard assets. It was instead entirely speculation about potential future utility. As the frenzy died down, there was no floor on how far valuations could fall. Even a portfolio of mortgages with a high default rate still has some economic value due the non-defaulting mortgages as well as the houses pledged as collateral.

And in some ways we are fortunate that crypto never developed any ties to the real economy. Despite crypto's spectacular collapse, we are not seeing any financial stress in the real world. I personally think there might even be some value in having this isolated and contained financial system that can serve as an outlet for financial gambling in that it can absorb the worst excesses of speculators.

Levine also muses about the educational value of this toy financial system. Over the years, crypto has provided him with numerous entertaining financial stories that can illustrate general financial concepts. For example, counterparty risk in trading and lending. In exploring crypto’s failures, Levine can explain the value of regulations and other mechanisms developed in the traditional financial system to guard against such failures. Many people have described crypto as a speedrun in developing a financial system and that is quite educational.

I strongly recommend checking out the article. Particularly like this explanation of how the FTX collapse is framed in terms of the toy financial system model.

> What happened at FTX? “They stole the money” seems to be a true but insufficient answer. I think that part of the answer is that they found, and helped to build, a toy financial system, and they played with it. They didn’t take the game too seriously; they didn’t spend a lot of energy hiring accountants and compliance people, because that is not the fun part of finance. They built clever systems for margin lending and risk management, because it is fun to build an idealized trading system from scratch. But they also exempted themselves—Alameda—from that system, because it was just a game. In the real world, if you run a hedge fund and your balance becomes negative, the game is over. At FTX, when Alameda’s balance became negative, it got to keep playing."

I recall this being an insightful discussion of the evolution of the Republican party, particularly the contradictions and conflicts between the elite Reagan-era consensus and the populist Buchanan/Trump wing. From the NYT description

> Continetti was straddling two conservative tendencies that were about to rip apart, the establishment conservatism of George W. Bush and Bill Kristol, and the populist conservatism of Spiro Agnew, and soon, Donald Trump. And rip apart they did. Today, the right that Continetti joined, it barely exists. “The Weekly Standard” is gone. Kristol became a leading Never Trumper. Trump took over the Republican Party in part by weaponizing anger and disappointment at its establishment, and particularly at the Bush family. The policy ideas so dutifully churned out by the American Enterprise Institute for so many years have little purchase on the rising generation of populist right leaders. In many cases, they’re running against those ideas. Continetti writes that — quote — “to define oneself as a conservative in the 2020s was to reject the ideas and practices of the establishment that 1150 17th Street had come to represent. I’ve spent the last decade thinking about this change.”

> The product of Continetti’s decade of thinking and research isn’t a manifesto or an essay. It’s a history book, “In the Right: The 100 Year War for American Conservatism.” Continetti does something valuable. He takes seriously the populist history of conservatism, running from Joseph McCarthy to William F. Buckley Jr., to the John Birch Society, to Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew, to the Tea Party, and Sarah Palin, and Donald Trump, and beyond. He doesn’t treat the forces that produced Trumpism as somehow alien to the Republican Party. What’s aberrational is not a populist right, but the belief, so widespread before Donald Trump, that conservatism was what Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell and “The Weekly Standard” and the American Enterprise Institute wanted it to be, that that is where the energy and the values of the people who put Republicans in power really sat."

I.e., the reason that so many have too little is because a few have too much. Particularly when inequality only focuses on the wealthiest.

I think we are led astray due to 1) a focus on dollars and 2) not differentiating between income and wealth; one being a rate and the other being a quantity. I.e., dollars/year vs. cumulative dollars. We should instead focus on tangible resources such as land, labor, and commodities.

If we took everything that billionaires consume—including their consumption of shelter by living in mansions and yachts—and reappropriated that to society's neediest, we’d barely make a dent in their standard of living. There just aren’t that many billionaires and their aggregate consumption is miniscule with respect to the tens of millions of low-income Americans.

If we expand inequality to include the top 10% or 20% of households, then we can start to see some significant tangible resource consumption that could be redistributed to address economic hardship. We can, and should, take a Western-European approach to restructuring our economy to increase public services at the expense of private consumption through higher progressive taxes. Particularly we need a labor restructuring; fewer bartenders and personal trainers, more childcare workers and primary care physicians.

But we can also address economic hardship through productivity growth. Afterall, our redistribution efforts will always be limited by the goods and services that we are actually capable of producing. If we improve productivity through technological advancement and targeted education, then we’ll simply be capable of generating far more goods and services. And we’ll get less political pushback due to a lower tax burden. Ideally everyone’s consumption can grow."

Did Reaganism cause this? Specifically, I don’t think he ever succeeded in cutting government spending on welfare. Reagan just cut taxes and funded the massive deficit through debt financing. If anything, that should’ve been a large economic stimulus, although it may have only stimulated suboptimal parts of the economy. E.g., finance.

Additionally, looking at the growth in Real Disposable Personal Income, it looks like the slowdown started in the 70s, following a boom in the 60s, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A067RL1A156NBEA

It could be argued that the failure was in not continuing the expansion of the welfare state though continuation of initiatives like the New Deal and Great Society. But there also were many broad changes in the economy due to technology and globalization. War-torn Europe and Japan had recovered and entered the world markets with innovative and superior products. Information technologies started automating aspects of production and administration, which increased productivity by capital-labor substitution.

In many ways, I think the post-war era up through the 60s was the exception. We were in an unusual environment with America as the sole industrial power and that is not something that we can recreate. We also still had a primitive production system that required massive quantities of unskilled labor. The world has changed, largely for the better in my opinion, and we need to consider that in analyzing historical developments."

How are kids like their parents? But half of the genetic variability is within families. Right. Genetics is also about difference and the way that differences play out. How are my kids different from me, how are my kids different from one another? And so, you know, often when people kind of back up to a very strong you know, “there is no way that genetics influences something like education or intelligence or personality.” I really am like, have you ever spent time with children before? Like, have you been around them? Because I think if you are around them, particularly if you're around, you know, siblings or cousins, you have this front row seat to see how genetic difference plays out, very early in development. Like my children as infants felt very, very different to me in terms of their temperament. And then also like what they elicited from me in terms of my maternal behavior.

Even fine to feel disgust and revulsion at it. I think it useful for those of us that are sympathetic to GiveWell’s moral foundation to understand our beliefs are quite repulsive to some other thoughtful people.

Further, I think we all have some innate hierarchy of preferences that bias towards people and communities closer to us. Almost everyone feels a strong obligation to care for our immediate family and humans require severe conflicts to sever that. Similarly, many would feel compelled to help a close friend in need as well as some heightened concern about local issues.

But many of us can adopt a universalist view towards philanthropy. I’ll admit that it may be easier when our family and friends are generally doing well financially. Further, those of us who regularly moved throughout our lives may feel limited, if any, obligation to our locality. Regardless of how we adopted our moral intuitions, we truly believe in a general obligation to all humans and want to donate funds with a focus on effectiveness at addressing human suffering.

I don’t think anyone should feel guilt or shame for rejecting GiveWell’s moral framework. Similarly, no one should feel bad about accepting it.

What it ensures is that, with no principled way to evaluate projects or say no to things, costs explode.

The cynic in me wants to believe that agency leaders would like to avoid a simple and objective measure of performance. If they are solely evaluated by ridership/dollar-spent then they could fail to improve on that metric and be charged with bad decision making. In contrast, if they claim to be balancing numerous unquantifiable objectives, then it’s much harder to criticize their performance. For example, if we point out the low ridership volume then they can point to their progress in expanding access and creating good paying jobs.

And I think there is a general tendency for all leaders and workers to resist objective evaluation. For example, I've seen this criticism applied to the anti-testing movement in education where it is alleged that poor teachers simply want to evade detection.

I’ve also seen this aversion to performance evaluation within the tech industry, particularly within discussions on the tech forum Hacker News. While there are many poor approaches to measuring software developer performance (e.g., lines of code count), there still need to be some objective evaluation. Quality measures can include annual peer review using a rubric of dimensions.

Yet there is commonly fierce objection to any evaluation of software engineers within such discussions. Numerous excuses are given for any proposal, while no alternatives are offered. It seems software engineering is conceived as some impalpable art that cannot be evaluated, even by fellow artists. And this extends to strategies and criteria for interviewing prospective engineers. All commonly used methods, such as whiterboarding code exercises, are castigated as inadequate to measure the intangible brilliance and abilities of engineers.

I just think we all have some natural aversion to being evaluated for fear of failure. Therefore our institutions, both public and private, need to be designed to counteract that tendency."

Here’s a recent article from Gergely Orosz about the topic that I generally agree with, “Performance Reviews for Software Developers”, https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/performance-reviews-for-software-engineers/

Off the top of my head, here are some dimensions I’ve commonly seen used
* Technical Skills - At each Eng level, what are the expected capabilities?
* Impact - What degree of contribution is expected for each level?
* Mentorship - For higher levels, the mentorship responsibilities
* Leadership - Again, higher levels, the degree that they should drive the team and interact with other teams
* Collaboration - How well do they help other people get stuff done?
* Interview - For higher levels, how involved should they be in interviewing? How well are their decisions calibrated against other interviewers for the same candidates?

For each dimension, an engineer will be ranked on a scale of 0-5. The rubric will include criteria and examples for each score.

On an annual basis, each team member will review other team members as assigned by their manager. Only the manager sees the results of each review and they combine multiple reviews to create an aggregated performance evaluation. That can then be shared with the team member to learn how well they are performing against expectations and their progress towards promotion.

While never perfect, the rubric is regularly revised in an iterative process using feedback from all team members. The result is a clear description of expectations and current performance for all members on the team."

I have no idea. I can barely make small talk at a party.

I’m surprised that delivering critical feedback is framed as an unsolvable problem or something that people just have a natural talent for because there has been mountains of writing on the topic. Further, critiquing someone's work is generally much easier than having to deliver feedback on something like behavior.

I’ve found two principles helpful for critiquing work
* Feedback should be immediate and specific
* Don’t forget positive feedback

Immediacy ensures that the work is still top of mind. Waiting a day or two can reduce the connection to the work and the actions taken in its creation.

For writing, specificity entails comments on individual paragraphs, sentences, or even word choices. Ideally, alternatives can be suggested to demonstrate the suggestion. E.g., here’s how this sentence could be tightened up. Feedback can also include suggestions about the order of information. But again be specific. Rather than saying it flows poorly, suggest how you’d reorder the document. This level of review takes time and it’s worth it.

Positive feedback is in my opinion more important than critical feedback. Not because it makes the recipient feel good—that is a nice side effect—but because it lets them know their strengths. For example, if their writing is clear and concise, then they needn’t focus much on tightening up their sentences, and should instead focus on other areas. And it also needs to be specific. Just saying “good article” is useless. Positive feedback also builds the expectation of feedback and makes it easier to deliver and receive critical critique.

For more on this topic, I’d recommend Auren Hoffman’s, “Why Specific Positive Feedback is So Important”, https://summation.net/2020/02/19/why-specific-positive-feedback-is-so-important/

Auren was the CEO of a tech company that I worked for and he ensured this principle permeated the culture. That had a notable impact on how we helped each other deliver solid work and grow in capabilities. It also made it easier to deliver critical critique since we had a general culture of expecting feedback."

I think this is a common challenge of being a manager—particularly when one starts the role—due to the lack of constraints in terms of work expectations. The nature of the role ensures we are constantly learning of new problems and have to add these to our infinitely growing backlog. There is always more that a manager could do.

To address that, I was advised to triage and prioritize each issue in terms of two dimensions: urgency and importance. Particularly, the need to identify urgent, yet unimportant issues. Due to the time-sensitive nature, it is tempting to try to address these. That can result in insufficient time devoted to important, yet non-urgent issues. Instead, those unimportant problems need to be quickly rejected.

For example, a manager might be invited to meetings or asked to review documents about stuff that is only tangentially related to their team's work. Those need to be quickly rejected with a simple explanation about being out of scope. That opens time for important, yet non-urgent issues, like deep-thinking on feedback for reports.

Further, working with people is inherently imperfectible so many problems are never finally solved; they are at best minimized to be tolerable. At some level, I think it just takes time to accept that."

I think this faith results from the enticing simplicity of the corruption theory as well as its congruence with our intuition about human affairs. Our brains evolved in an environment consisting of small tribes where a few people could have a significant impact. We therefore naturally want to identify the key actors and their motives that conflict with our goals when society doesn’t function as we desire.

Hence these conspiracy theories have an intrinsic advantage in the “marketplace of ideas.” In contrast, the failings of well-intentioned bureaucrats requires understanding the management structure and incentives of complex, non-intuitive institutions.

Similarly, we struggle to comprehend the diverse interests and sincere beliefs of our country’s legislative representatives and their ever-shifting alliances. It’s hard enough for us to understand how individual people can have radically different models of reality than ourselves, yet alone project that onto large groups of people.

So we fall back on simple narratives centered on a few corrupt villains."

> But the American vice presidency is an infamously weird job. The VP has no real area of responsibility, so allocating the VP post to someone doesn’t give them any policy wins. At the same time, the VP’s role is extremely important because presidents really do die in office sometimes. The United States’ singular national unity experiment ended disastrously for precisely this reason. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln thought it would be smart to put pro-war Democrat Andrew Johnson on the ticket to maximize political support for the overwhelmingly important cause of defeating the Confederacy. Then, tragically, Lincoln was murdered.

> First off, while Radical Reconstruction was ultimately abandoned and thus in some sense “failed,” it’s important in Slow Boring terms to say that it didn’t backfire and somehow leave the cause of civil rights worse off than it was under Andrew Johnson’s policies.

> Second, looking back on the politics of the 1870s and 1880s, it seems to me that Reconstruction was in fact the most important issue of the day. I’ve often criticized Biden-era Democrats for not setting priorities in a clear or reasonable way. But it was totally reasonable for the Grant administration to prioritize Reconstruction over pursuing GOP goals on the tariff or whatever else they were up to. So in a narrow sense, I don’t think the Radical Republicans did anything wrong.

> In a broader sense, though, they didn’t actually accomplish what they set out to accomplish, so there is an interesting question of how things could have turned out differently.

> Academic historians don’t like to formally consider counterfactuals, which I think is unfortunate. But one way of putting the “old” view of Reconstruction is that it was always doomed to fail for some racist reason — freedmen were incapable of self-government or peaceful coexistence of people from different racial groups was impossible — so the Radicals were foolish to try and only caused harm. I think the “new” view tends to be equally fatalistic, just putting the blame on racism — white supremacist ideology was too deeply ingrained in American civic culture — and holds up the Radicals as noble (albeit doomed) heroes. But I do wonder about contingency.

> One scenario to consider is what would’ve happened if Abraham Lincoln hadn’t dumped Hannibal Hamlin from the ticket in 1864 in favor of Jackson the War Democrat. In the original 1860 GOP ticket, Lincoln was the midwestern moderate and Hamlin was there to provide representation to the more hardline faction of the party. Lincoln swapped Hamlin for Johnson to help secure re-election, but in the end the 1864 election wasn’t very close. The Lincoln-Hamlin ticket maybe wins a bit more narrowly but they still win. And now instead of Lincoln’s assassination bringing to power a white supremacist Democrat, it puts a Radical in office at a time when the military is still publicly mobilized and the population is primed for vengeance. I think a Hamlin-led Reconstruction would have been much harsher from the outset, potentially featuring things like real land reform that could have led to a durable Reconstruction order.

> The other is that as best as I can tell, GOP political fortunes were dealt a heavy blow both in the 1874 midterms (where Democrats gained the House majority) and in 1876 by the fallout from an economic crisis known as the Panic of 1873. The quality of economic data from this era is not great, but Andrew Jalil’s paper on the history of American banking crises suggests it kicked off a pretty serious recession. Could this have been prevented? I don’t know — historians seem a little uncertain as to why the panic happened at all. But Grant did veto a controversial piece of legislation in 1874 known as the Inflation Bill and the economy instead experienced deflation. Perhaps if they’d given it a better name like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Grant would have signed it, the economy would have prospered, and the Reconstruction coalition would have stayed in place longer."

Numerous constitutional law experts and politicians have made the argument that the debt ceiling violates this part of the constitution as explained in that Wikipedia section. There are certainly nuances beyond my legal comprehension, including how the debt ceiling was introduced to avoid congressional authorization of individual treasuries issuances, so I can’t speculate on how this could play out.

Further, there is the more general constitutional question of what should the Executive do when Congress passes contradictory legislation. E.g., mandating spending without authorizing sufficient funds, either through taxes or debt issuance authorization. It could be argued that the Executive has discretion in resolving this contradiction, including ignoring the debt ceiling.

To safeguard against global financial meltdown in the event of a suicidal judiciary decision, we can prepare and pre-annonunce a platinum coin fallback. In the event of an injunction barring new treasuries issuance beyond the debt ceiling, then we’ll simply purchase existing government debt from the Fed using a platinum coin and then retire those treasuries, thereby putting us back under the limit. Both the Treasury and the Fed will be standing by, ready to take these actions at a moment's notice.

And we could trigger that meltdown even before an actual default as financial market participants position themselves for a potential default.

We already see signs of this repositioning as Tracy Alloway explained yesterday in, “The Bond Market Is Already Worrying About a Debt-Ceiling Debacle”,  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/the-bond-market-is-already-worrying-about-a-debt-ceiling-debacle

We’ll see larger perturbations in markets as we get closer to a potential default. Those dislocations will reverberate all throughout global financial markets since US treasuries are foundational to the entire financial system. That could lead to liquidity (i.e., insufficient cash) and solvency (i.e., bankruptcy) issues for numerous market participants. That is what happened in the 2008 global financial crisis and treasuries are far more important than mortgages.

Hence, even just the possibility of a debt crisis and US treasuries default could cause an unimaginably larger financial crisis."

For context, Lehman failed on Sept 15th and the markets were already in meltdown mode by the time the majority of Republicans rejected TARP on Oct 3rd.

> The dumbest thing in economics, the US government’s debt ceiling, is clattering into relevance again. Basically the US Department of the Treasury has to pay the US government’s bills, and to do that it issues debt, and every time it issues new debt it adds a little to the total amount of debt outstanding, and eventually the debt outstanding reaches some arbitrary number called the “debt ceiling.” And then Treasury can’t issue any more debt, unless Congress raises the debt ceiling. Which it can easily do — it’s just an arbitrary number! — but Republicans in Congress keep threatening not to, and if that happens then the government can’t pay its bills and defaults on its obligations.

> But there is a real risk that Congress won’t, so today Bloomberg Opinion contributor Matt Yglesias has a Substack column arguing that Treasury should solve the problem of the debt ceiling using premium bonds. 

Levine goes into a lot of details of legal stuff and some bond math. The conclusion,

> Anyway as a matter of financial engineering I find this fun to think about. As an actual thing for the US Treasury to do, I think it is obviously very bad; the US Treasury market, perhaps the most important financial market in the world, should not be run on accounting gimmicks.

Thompson references a NYT piece about how party leadership has lost control over candidate selection. In that 2016 election, both Trump and Sanders—like Obama before them—were able to leverage internet platforms to sidestep party elites, including journalists, and go straight to the voters with their novel messages.

> This is a big problem for the parties as described in The Party Decides. Remember, in Noel and company’s description party actors care more about their policy preferences than they do voter preferences, but in an aggregated world it is voters aka users who decide which issues get traction and which don’t.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell weighed in on this in Oct 2022 and I didn’t find his rebuff that persuasive. Particularly the following statement, [1]

> We’ve got a dual mandate—maximum employment and price stability—and it comes down to: Is nominal income [GDP] targeting the best way to promote that? We don’t think it is; I don’t think it is. And part of that is that it would be very difficult, I think, to explain to the public the relationship between a nominal income target (nominal GDP target) to those goals. It’s just … a level of complexity that even some economists and policymakers struggle with, let alone the general public. So, it seems like it would be a reach to have that be our fundamental framework.

I don’t think the general public understands much at all about monetary policy and NGDP targeting could simply be abstracted away as one of the mechanisms used by the Fed to achieve its current goals of price stability and maximizing employment. Almost none of us understand the current mechanisms—e.g., quantitative easing/tightening and facilities like reverse repo—and that hasn’t stopped the Fed from using these powerful tools.

Excellent distillation of this common theme on Slow Boring. I personally struggle with this tradeoff between liberalism and democracy, and I imagine others do as well. The contrast with the Middle East makes the issue particularly poignant.

The American far-right's flirtation with anti-democratic ideas is at times more frightening than their illiberal ones. Notably Peter Thiel’s belief that democracy and freedom are incompatible, and he supports freedom; freedom defined in a radical libertarian way.

At times I’m tempted to accept some federalist or localist approaches to resolving our differences. Afterall, we are a highly pluralistic country with a diverse set of values and goals. Maybe that would allow us to stop fighting about some stuff and just agree to disagree.

If letting states and cities take highly differentiated approaches to issues like education allows us to resolve our political hostilities on these issues, then that might be a palatable solution. I could even begrudgingly accept “school choice” proposals, including vouchers valid for private religious schools. Parents care a ton about their children's upbringing and I could see value in ending these culture war fights if parents can be satisfied by choosing from multiple options.

While I don’t like this, continuing to fight about these deeply-believed issues at the national level may present worse risks when one side feels that they are losing due to the democratic outcome.

And we liberals might once again be one the losing side one day."

Liberalism doesn’t seem to be something that you can force on people. If anything, attempting to do so is a contradiction since liberalism is centered around individual autonomy and pluralism.

And in general, I think few regimes have succeeded in forcing any beliefs on people. At most they can jail or execute dissidents, leaving just people that appear to believe. That eventually fails when people act on their actual beliefs through a revolution."

If I have time after work, I’ll try to write a longer response about how that fits into my understanding, but please don’t feel any obligation to further engage since we’re all quite busy.

My understanding is that some degree of output estimation is necessary for our current Fed policy because they don’t want to overreact to short-term, rapid price swings. In other words, they want to “see through transient disruptions.”

I don’t reference the Fed’s former language in a derogatory manner because I do believe they were correct to not overreact to the chaos of the pandemic. There was tons of uncertainty and on average more harm would be done from hasty action. I’ve seen the argument that NGDP targeting could’ve led to a slightly faster reaction, but even that comes down to nuances of implementation and policy maker’s judgment.

Currently, I’m not personally convinced any policy framework change is needed. And I can understand the Fed deferring even discussing future changes until the economy has normalized."

It’s totally possible that the markets could go haywire well before the US actually defaults if investors aren’t sufficiently confident the government is good for its money.

For example, just look at how the UK government debt market went into meltdown following short-lived-prime-minister Truss’s proposed economic plan.

Rather than simple likes, comments in this system are tagged with labels like “Insightful”, “Flamebait”, “Overrated”, etc. Not every user could participate in tagging. Instead, Slashdot had some heuristics to determine whether a user could serve as a “moderator” based upon the users comment quality history, account age, randomization, and meta-moderation of their previous tagging. Even then, users were limited in tagging power by being assigned moderation points at times, based on those heuristics, and each moderation decision cost them one point.

The full Slashdot system would be needlessly overcomplicated for just one Substack. Instead, at the simplest level, just the site author could apply tags. The author could define their own tags as well as how each factors into ranking. Eg, “Insightful” could be +1, “Flamebait” -1, and untagged just zero. To avoid groupthink, the tags could remain hidden for a day or so.

As a programmer, I could imagine a more sophisticated system that lets each user determine how to use tags contributed by all subscribers, on a per-a-subscriber basis. One could recreate the default Substack system by ranking comments using just a “Like” tag and considering all “Like” tags, contributed by all other subscribers, equally. At the other extreme, someone would likely have 5000 lines of SQL-esque logic declaring their sophisticated taste in comment consumption based upon select subscribers’ tagging decisions."

As an aside, similar to the narrative that Protestantism drove cultural changes that laid the groundwork for capitalism, I’ve also heard a credible theory that it was essential to the development of liberalism. Notably, Protestant beliefs, or even more generally Christian theology, invented and enshrined the concept of the individual due its central focus on personal salvation. Prior to that, it’s my understanding that religious and cultural beliefs were largely centered around families, tribes, city states, ethnic groups, and empires.

It is my layperson understanding that this is what made Christianity such a disruptive religion. Not only did it build off Judaism's rejection of all other gods—something that was quite threatening to Roman authorities in and of itself—it further upset traditional relationships in social groups by creating a potent individual desire and rejection of the traditional order. I believe that there are even some bible verses where Jesus instructs his followers to leave their families and communities in order to devote themselves to his teachings.

The Protestant Reformation rediscovered this individual-salvation focus and challenged the existing social order that the Catholic Church had built in the subsequent milenia. Further, its focus on scriptural purity compelled Protestants to promote literacy so that everyone could seek their salvation by directly reading the bible. That created an increasingly educated populace as more people could now also read other materials.

Overall, I find this to be an interesting and credible historical narrative, and it does increase my appreciation for religion as an atheist."

Ultimately, I think zoning reform will only be accepted by its current opponents when it becomes the solution to resisting even worse changes. For example, should remote work and tech layoffs weaken the tax base of tech hubs like San Francisco, then these cities could find themselves in a fiscal crisis. New development—with its associated fees, taxes, and land value enhancement—could be seen as an acceptable resolution when the alternative is austerity in the form of tax hikes and service cuts."

It applies when an individual merely owns a gun, even if it’s sitting unused in their closet. If they ever carry or use it, the penalties shoot up dramatically.

I find it interesting to contrast Stern defense of weakening the penalties for illegal firearm possession against his passionate defense of gun control in his June 2022 article, “Clarence Thomas’ Maximalist Second Amendment Ruling Is a Nightmare for Gun Control”, https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/06/supreme-court-new-york-concealed-carry-law-gun-control-bruen.html

> The Supreme Court commenced a revolution in Second Amendment law on Thursday, striking down New York’s strict limits on concealed carry in a maximalist opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas that renders most of the nation’s gun control laws presumptively unconstitutional. The decision will unleash a tidal wave of lower court rulings invalidating laws designed to protect Americans from the carnage of gun violence. And it will stymie current efforts to reduce that violence through innovative new solutions to this epidemic. For gun control advocates, it is the worst-case scenario.

Note, I wasn’t aware of Stern’s earlier work fervently advocating for gun control to, in his words, “protect Americans from the carnage of gun violence”. I just assumed that existed based on his politics and Google immediately validated my hypothesis.

I think this highlights a recurring contradiction on the social justice activists approach to guns, violent crimes, and law enforcement: Guns are evil incarnate and they should be banned, but our similarly evil criminal justice system and the police cannot be trusted to enforce our current prohibitions on gun possession.

This is deeply frustrating to me and I think it suggests a general lack of seriousness among these activists with regard to the problem of violent crime and guns. We already have laws on the book that could greatly decrease gun violence, yet the strongest gun control advocates are squeamish in enforcing those laws. Further, they continue to argue for more gun restrictions, which would require even more police action and incarceration, while simultaneously arguing for weakening of all law enforcement.

Taken to the extreme, it seems these activists' ideal outcome is a complete ban on all guns, yet zero enforcement of that ban.

99102422,Recent layoffs at Big Tech don't spell economic doom,https://www.slowboring.com/p/recent-layoffs-at-big-tech-dont-spell,12343737,Matt Hagy,3094604,2023-01-30 07:03:17-05:00,17,0,3,,,12343737,3,-13,,"> A boom in startups and an expansion of technical talent outside the “tech” sector, meanwhile, would lay the foundations for a stronger economy over the long run.

I agree that this normalization of the tech labor market will be good for the economy as a whole, and I further believe it will benefit the tech industry in the long term. I say this as a software engineer who has benefited from the extremely tight labor market and will likely face slower compensation growth and fewer competing employment opportunities due to the correction.

Entrepreneurs and startup engineers on forums like Hacker News have long complained about FAANG firms hoarding talent with their high salaries and ever increasing stock prices (a good portion of senior tech worker comp is in stock that vests over four years.) While it’s easy to dismiss these “woe is me” complaints from startup execs and venture capitalists, this fierce tech labor competition almost certainly suppressed the formation and growth of startups. We can see this in the continued dominance of incumbent tech firms and the lack of competition from rising startups.

Ultimately, tech needs the creative destruction process of disruptive new startups to advance. It will be good in the long term (possibly even medium term) for tech workers to take a slight bit of pain in order for some of us to found or join new startups. While most of the new ventures will fail, the survivors will offer radically new products and create even more impactful (and lucrative) employment opportunities.

The timing is great with the current excitement around recent AI advances. While there is a lot of wishcasting and overall BS with many of the prognostications of how AI will revolutionize the world, there certainly appears to be some real potential for radically new tech products. The hype will drive a lot of experimentation across a plethora of new startups. Most will fail and if any succeed they will change the world in ways that we can’t really predict.

Further, I also think that the tightening of financial conditions and the resulting correction in tech firm valuations will actually be beneficial to these startups. While many are bemoaning the pullback in tech investment and the increased challenges in raising venture capital, I think we need this correction; similar to how we need the tech labor market normalization. There was previously too much money chasing too few opportunities and this led to numerous bad investments. Eg, the countless crypto ponzis. The return of VC investment discipline will focus capital on discerning more promising opportunities and force entrepreneurs to be more efficient in how they deploy these funds.

Overall, as a tech worker, I’m quite excited for these corrections, even if I might face a slight bit of pain in the short term."

We just can’t do that while failing to hit our current target. If the central bank is willing to increase to 3% now, would we not expect them to increase it again should they find it challenging to hit that new target?

Central bank credibility is a real thing and the Fed losing it in the 70s likely explains a lot of the macroeconomic chaos in that time period. They only regained that with the Volcker shocks and the associated deep recessions.

Financial markets need to believe that a central bank can and will keep its promises. Otherwise, in the face of uncertainty, investors will be more aggressively hedging and speculating on volatile inflation and interest rates. That raises the cost of borrowing, including corp bonds and mortgages, which introduces its own flavor of economic pain. Similarly, sophisticated corporations will be more prone to continuously increasing prices if they fear price instability more than the risk of losing market share. 

This uncertainty resulting from the loss of central bank credibility creates a lot of economic volatility and pain that ultimately impacts households; both as workers and as consumers. Hence the Fed has to prove that they can keep their previous promises before promising something different in the future."

The Fed listened and acted with their Aug 2020 revised monetary policy named Flexible Average Inflation Targeting. [1] Brookings assessment of FAIT describes it as, [2]

> The Fed’s new framework—known as Flexible Average Inflation Targeting (FAIT)—grew out of a period in which inflation fell short of the 2 percent target and inflation expectations drifted down, despite very low interest rates and much lower unemployment than had previously been thought consistent with low, stable inflation. Keeping expectations from moving below 2 percent is especially important when the real equilibrium interest rate appears also to be quite low, making the zero low bound (ZLB) an increasingly salient policy constraint.

> The FAIT framework is well designed to counter the disinflationary bias imparted by policy being constrained by the ZLB from time to time. FAIT promises to make up for inflation below 2 percent by aiming to run it “moderately above 2 percent for some time”—a flexible form of price-level targeting. That implies easier policies for longer than if the Fed were simply aiming to return inflation to 2 percent without the makeup. The point of the averaging is to make sure expectations are indeed anchored at 2 percent. In effect, deliberately aiming for inflation to exceed 2 percent for some time and likely allowing the overshoot of maximum employment necessary to achieve that results in an upward inflation bias that offsets the downward bias arising from the ZLB.

> But there are other asymmetries in the new framework that lean toward taking upside risks on inflation and raise questions about how well adherence to the framework would anchor expectations in circumstances in which inflation wasn’t so quiescent.

Central banks have to be slow and methodical in revising their monetary policy frameworks. Yet they listen, learn—including their own inhouse research and academic collaborations—and eventually act.

But the demand comes first- specific projects that don’t have enough people to accomplish them. Though when we work on govt-funded projects, things can get upside down and we staff up to match a budget then scope the work from there.

> In terms of resources, major federal programs disproportionately benefit rural areas, in part because such areas have a disproportionate number of seniors receiving Social Security and Medicare. But even means-tested programs — programs that Republicans often disparage as “welfare” — tilt rural. Notably, at this point rural Americans are more likely than urban Americans to be on Medicaid and receive food stamps.

At least he ends on a slightly positive note about how Biden’s IRA provisions are creating more economic opportunities in disproportionately rural areas. He’s cynical that Democrats will get any credit—and rightfully so—but Krguman at least recognizes that improving the economic prospects of these areas may help us because, “ just maybe, reducing the heartland’s economic desperation will also help reverse its political radicalization.”

[2] Both touch on the political polarization and radicalization of people who feel left behind, and there is likely a lot of overlap between the two populations.

In that discussion, a common critique was that the Atlantic article wasn’t offering any solutions and instead just wants to “raise awareness” of the issue. The subtitle is even, “What to do about the deadly misfits among us? First, recognize the problem.” It continues to mainly just characterize how awful these people are and how we got to do something about them.

Numerous users pointed out that the writer appears to have zero empathy for these troubled young men, including those that are just starting down the path of radicalization and may be ripe for intervention. I’ll admit that the discussion forced me to recognize that I’m also lacking in concern for these individuals. Further, this Slow Boring article has me reflecting on my similar lack of empathy for the rural population. 

Yglesias points out that, despite our apparent concern about inequality, few of us progressives have much concern about urban/rural inequality. If anything, I think he is being too kind; many of us commonly talk quite dismissively about the rural population with insulting language that we’d be horrified to apply to any other group facing inequality.

I’m guessing that at some level we actually do need to develop some genuine empathy for troubled young men and rural communities if we want to help them out, reverse political radicalization/polarization, and ultimately win their votes. Pandering may help at the margin, but I don’t think it will get us far.

Developing such empathy for these out groups is certainly easier said than done. I don’t actually have any ideas, but hoping that I can at least start to recognize and mitigate my own negative biases against them as a starting point.

Well, there would have to be taxes on the table. And that means looking at ideas like revenue-raising tax reform.

I don’t get the politics of cutting entitlements (eg, Medicare and Social Security) in return for raising taxes on the affluent via reforming deductions in that both of those appear to be a negative for Democrats. Biden would have to break his promise to not hike taxes for those earning less than $400k/year and in return he’s getting cuts to some of the most popular federal programs. I just don’t see how he and other Democrats can generate any positive messaging around this.

Similarly, it doesn’t seem like much of a win for Republicans, although I’d admit that—as discussed in the article—Republicans don’t appear to have anything resembling a coherent fiscal policy platform. I get the impression that Republicans universally oppose tax increases, with a possible exception for their regressive “fair tax” federal sales tax, and while there are still some Paul-Ryan-era entitlement-reform Republicans, that appears to be a minority position within the party.

The politics around this deal just appear to be a loser for both Democrats and Republicans alike. Yes, these reforms would be beneficial from a macroeconomic perspective, but understanding that requires a level of technocratic sophistication that is totally absent from our electoral politics."

And I imagine that people who care enough about these false narratives to act on them are likely also engaging in other more productive behavior such as avoiding sugar and exercising more.

Nonetheless, a proper understanding of the cause hasn’t led to widespread success in solving the problem. I think most people know that we should eat less and healthier, and also exercise more. (And we should!) Yet knowledge alone is insufficient. I get the impression that most people who put this understanding into practice have their own obsession with diet and exercise, in a manner with some similarities to the seed oil nuts who incidentally also practice some actual healthy behavior.

Speaking from my own experience and that of my friends, maintaining a healthy weight requires a fair amount of conscious focus. It’s certainly do-able, but it demands dedicating a significant amount of time and effort, which seems to be best facilitated by compulsion.

I don’t think we should underestimate the economic value of content generation. Facebook does $117.9B in revenue and Youtube gets $28.8B, both using largely user generated content. Imagine if the quality of all of this content could be massively improved through generative AI, while dropping the content generation cost to near zero. 

For example, rather than animating through illustrators, a creator could just give their script to a generative AI and it would create the appropriate animation video. That could be iteratively refined until the creator is happy with the results. And of course a ChatGPT-like AI could help generate the script itself.

In the extreme case, generative AI might one day offer visuals on par with our most advanced CGI methods. Now any individual can generate video at that level just by writing a script and every video on Youtube would have production value on par with blockbuster films.

For education, we could imagine a ChatGPT-like AI that serves as an individualized tutor. It would engage the student in a conversation and adapt not only to their knowledge-level, but also to their unique interests. Eg, a history AI could learn that a student is quite excited by tales of warfare and guide them through human history in a war-centered narrative.

Alternatively, if they show more engagement on biographies, then the student would get stories of the lives and times of historical figures. The AI could also generate fictional narratives about common people in each era, informed by historical records, to avoid the “great man” bias of this approach. Stories would be adapted around themes and characters that are found to maximize engagement for each student.

This extends to other disciplines. Math taught through problem sets that address specific challenges faced by protagonists in a movie. You gotta help them solve the problem in order for the plot to advance. Murder mysteries where you need to learn enough biology and chemistry to determine whether a poisoning is likely. The student could even serve as a member of the Manhattan project, doing physics R&D as they build the first atom bomb.

Yes, this is all aimless speculation and more science fiction than actual science. Yet I think there is a valuable thought experiment in thinking through the most engaging and impactful education we could provide a student if we dedicated a team of human expert tutors."

From episode description, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-dan-savage.html

> For decades now, Savage has been arguing that our expectations for long-term partnerships are way too high; that healthy relationships are about acknowledging our vast spectrum of desires, not repressing them; and that monogamy is not the ideal setup for every partnership. 

It’s certainly a provocative position that even fairly open-minded people can find offensive. Yet Savage makes some astute observations about monogamy and a solid argument for considering open relationships. Particularly, “Monogamy is literally the only thing humans attempt where perfection is the only metric of success.”

From the transcript, I find these excerpts best summarizes his thoughts.

> DAN SAVAGE: The idea that monogamy is a choice a couple makes, and a choice a couple can revisit, that monogamy shouldn’t be a default setting, it should be something that you opt into and can opt out of over the life of a relationship. …
> Being in love, if you’ve made a monogamous commitment, might mean you don’t sleep with anybody else, out of respect for your partner, and the choice you made, and the choice you made together, but you’re still going to want to sleep with somebody else, and expecting that other person to pretend they don’t want to sometimes, that they aren’t tempted, and getting angry whenever you stumble over evidence that your partner might be attracted to somebody else, which isn’t me giving permission to people to be insensitive or cruel about sometimes finding other people attractive, if you’re in an exclusive relationship, but it’s such an engine of conflict. That’s what I began to see when I first started getting a lot of letters from straight people, that these expectations — that love meant you didn’t sleep with anybody else at all, true and lasting relationships were monogamous relationships, it created so much stress and tension, and it wound up ending a lot of really good relationships and imperfect ones. And monogamy is sort of my hobbyhorse. Monogamy is literally the only thing humans attempt where perfection is the only metric of success.

I recommend listening to the episode and considering this and Savage’s other unconventional positions on relationships."

He argues that prostitution is just particularly transparent in its transactional nature, but shouldn’t be seen as any less legitimate since this is a feature of all relationships.

From the transcript,  https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/podcasts/ezra-klein-show-transcript-dan-savage.html

> I think all relationships, if you really peel the layers back far enough, are, at some point, transactional. I pay for it with my husband. I don’t pay for it with cash money. I pay for it with time, attention, affection, concern, making sure he goes to see the doctor when he needs to go see the doctor. There’s a reason married people live longer. If I stopped paying in like that, if I stopped caring about him, if he stopped paying in like that, stopped paying me with those same ephemeral, intangible, but very important things, our relationship would collapse.

> We see transactional relationships everywhere, and if you know people who are sex workers, a lot of what they’re paid for is not sex, it’s time, it’s attention, it’s focus, and if we have a culture that tells people that, if you ever had to pay for it with cash, you’re a loser, or a monster, or both, it makes the one outlet that some people may have, the one way that some people may pay for it, that other people who are also paying for it might not pay for it, it closes that lane down. [...] [I]f we could also recognize that all relationships, all sexual relationships, all emotional relationships are, on some level, transactional, and, therefore, we shouldn’t stigmatize the ones that are more evidently transactional.

Yes, there probably is some truth there. Further, some relationships may be improved by moving away from an “unconditional love” mindset towards recognizing that it takes work, including acts that demonstrate one’s care for their partner, to promote relationship health."

He and his husband have been married since 1991 so it seems they have a particularly stable relationship with that attribute. Hence, I don’t think he needs to advocate for “the ability to sleep around.”

Instead, I think he arrived at this position due to the thousands of letters sent to his sex advice column over the decades about the challenges of monogamy, temptation, and cheating. He further draws on empirical data that cheating is rampant. Eg, a 2020 YouGov poll finding 18% of US adults have cheated on their partner. [1]

Savage isn’t against exclusive monogamy, but instead recognizes it may be suboptimal for some relationships. If the alternative is cheating and divorce, then considering open relationships may be an improvement. Or at least couples should discuss this relatively early in their relationship, with exclusivity being an explicit decision, and the discussion continuing as their relationship evolves.

I’m not fully onboard with his argument, but I also don’t think we should immediately dismiss it due to visceral revulsion or reducing it to “men just wanna sleep around.”

A) We need better procedures to make these skydivers more diligent in checking and preparing their gear. We might even hope to promote a culture of responsibility, possibly by posthumously shaming anyone who’s chute failed to open.
B) Some people shouldn’t skydive.

I see Savage as arguing for an analogous B approach for relationships: Exclusive monogamy doesn’t work for some people. That doesn’t mean they should never have committed relationships, just that those relationships can’t be dependent on exclusivity. Similarly, people that lack the discipline for skydiving needn’t forgo all hobbies; instead they might look into golf."

This is the result of modern programming tools—notably compilers and runtimes, which are themselves computer programs—becoming sufficiently powerful to abstract away all of the technical challenges. For example, until well into the 80s most software engineers spent a substantial amount of time solving the problem of, “how will my program manage memory?”. Ie, how to use RAM. This is a hard engineering problem that not only drastically affects program performance, but also an error prone area where a single mistake could crash the program, or worse create security vulnerabilities.

Decades of computer science research and engineering has resulted in modern programming tools that totally abstract away memory management. Now the mass majority of programmers needn’t ever concern themselves with this hard technical problem. Numerous other advances in programming tools have similarly freed developers from previous technical challenges. Further, we now also have a plethora of reusable components in the form of code libraries and standardized software services (eg, software-as-a-service and cloud infrastructure) that we can leverage to abstract away almost any conceivable technical problem.

AI programming tools continue that trend, yet someone still has to figure out the specific intended behavior of the software service or product to an excruciating level of detail. I think this could be illustrated with an analogy to lawyers writing legal contracts. Lawyers can already draw from a large library of reference (or template) contracts from previous similar situations. In many cases these can be largely reused with minor modification. This is comparable to how programming can use existing libraries and services.

AI can certainly automate the drafting of contracts or computer code when the situation is sufficiently novel that reuse isn’t appropriate. Yet a practitioner still has to verify all of the details and make revisions to ensure intended behavior when executed in a court or computer. In programming, most of the time is spent figuring out what these details with a high degree of specificity through discussions with stakeholders, including end users or their representatives.

So while AI will likely substantially increase programming productivity, it is just a continuation of a trend. Even in the absence of AI programming tools, I think the field has been substantially commodified to the point that many, if not most, people could be a programmer. And the main challenge of determining intended software behavior at a high-level of detail still remains."

This is basically the same as the unbundling of bags or meals.
> In particular, the unbundling of seat assignments has been bad for parents and children.

What is the specific proposal? Do all economy seats have the same price? Wouldn’t that just lead to aisle and window seats filling up quickly, with late comers settling for a center seat? If anything, the price mechanism of deferring seat assignment to save money ensures that there are more opportunities to book contiguous seats for other travelers.

Or instead, is there special pricing and seat assignment if you can prove you’re booking for a family? Does anyone booking multiple seats (eg, group corporate travel) get to access preferential treatment to select contiguous seats?"

An important piece of industry trivia is that credit card companies charge merchants a percentage of the transaction, and further they charge different rates for different cards. This variable fee is called interchange and it can vary from around 1.4% to 3.5%. [1] Interchange is retained by the card issuing bank (eg, Chase), not the card network (eg, Visa). The rewards cards charge higher interchange and that is how the issuing bank can pay such generous rewards. Eg, this is how 2% cash back is funded for premium cards.

Further, card network rules require merchants to charge the same price regardless of the payment mechanism. Hence, the higher fees for rewards cards have to be blended into a higher sales price, and the effect is that generous cardholder rewards are subsidized by other consumers who pay with cash, debit, or entry-level cards. This results in economic redistribution from the poor to the affluent since higher-rewards cards are held by those with higher incomes. [2]

The EU has recognized this problem and addressed it by capping interchange at 0.3%. [3] The US should do the same. That will of course eliminate rewards cards, and that is a good thing because of their inherent inequality.

Debit card rates are already capped in the US by the 2010 Durbin amendment, but it has a loophole for small issuing banks; banks with less than $10 billion in assets are not subjected to this limitation. [4] We should close that loophole.

Bit of industry trivia on the Durbin amendment and the explosion of fintech from Patrick McKenzie, a tech/finance writer who previously worked at Stripe. [5]

> Think of a fintech company with a debit card. Square’s Cash App. Chime. Robinhood. Stripe Issuing, and users like Ramp and Bench. All of them, virtually without exemption, are brought to you courtesy of a small financial institution that you are unlikely to have heard of (unless you work in fintech or read Terms and Conditions for fun). Durbin exempt interchange is the revenue model which got a thousand pitch decks funded, because it is free to the ultimate consumer and protected by a moat guaranteed (for the moment) by Uncle Sam, contingent on the consumer choosing to use your app’s card.

Particularly, Bloomberg’s “Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day”, is a great daily newsletter for staying abreast of national and global events.

This control of distribution due to investments in physical infrastructure, and its disruption by the internet, is central for understanding the rapid change in our media ecosystem. Even the remaining legacy media institutions were impacted because to survive they had to adapt in competing with the plethora of new alternatives. Ben Thompson, a tech analyst, has suggested that the worst impact of Facebook and Twitter on our political discourse isn’t the vitriol and misinformation shared on those platforms, but instead how existing newspapers and broadcast news had to adapt their coverage to remain competitive. Hence their pivot to outrage and clickbait.

Thompsons 2014 article, “Newspapers Are Dead; Long Live Journalism”, [1] is a good overview of how the internet totally broke the business model of these previous journalism institutions. 

> Previously, advertising channels like newspapers or television channels were the only means to a captive audience. For example, if you wanted to reach those living in Chicago, the Chicago Tribune or Sun Times were your primary options. This proved highly lucrative for those in the middle; their job was to create compelling content to ensure customers bought their product, which was in turn laden with advertising, from whence they made most of their money.
> The Internet has changed this in a few fundamental ways:
> * On the Internet, consumers are no longer captive. I have an effectively infinite array of choices for news, entertainment, etc., meaning the content that attracts me must truly stand out
> * The infinite array of content = an infinite amount of advertising inventory, destroying its worth
> * The nature of Internet advertising makes it possible to gather much richer data about consumers than was ever possible offline
> This has made life in the middle much more difficult, particularly for old-school advertising middlemen like newspapers. Commanding top rates depends not only on capturing consumers versus infinitely more competitors, but also knowing more about those consumers than anyone else. Targeting information is the new scarcity in advertising. It is the only way to sustainably increase average revenue per user.
> “But [Insert Newspaper Name Here] has great journalists! They’ve won Pulitzer Prizes! And our democracy needs newspapers!” Unfortunately, advertisers don’t, and newspapers are paying the price for having long ago divorced the cost of their content from the value readers place upon it. To put it another way, it’s not that “the Internet has unbundled advertising from content creation,” it’s that advertisers (rightly) don’t give a damn about journalistic ideals. It is incredibly tiring to hear newspaper defenders talk as if advertising dollars are their god-given right, and that Google and Facebook are somehow stealing from them, when in reality Google and Facebook are winning in the fairest way possible: providing better value for the advertiser’s dollar.

So while I think it’s bad to spend your life feeding the audience’s appetite for bad articles, it’s not necessarily as wasteful as expending your tech skills on making smartphone apps more addictive.

There are absolutely other less-socially-harmful jobs that those clickbait writers could do, they just happen to be jobs that these writers **do not want to do**. Ie, non-journalist jobs. Eg, they could work in corporate PR, HR or recruitment. Or they could retrain to develop additional skills to apply in more-socially-beneficial jobs. Eg, train to become a technical writer developing manuals for renewal energy systems.

I don’t see how that is any different than a statistician choosing to work at Facebook on optimizing engagement (ie, addiction) rather than take a more socially beneficial job. Just like the writer who wants to be a journalist, the FB worker has their own preferences that they believe outweigh any moral considerations. Eg, a higher salary.

We can argue that it’s a matter of degrees; that social media addiction is more harmful than clickbait headlines; that there is a higher social opportunity cost in STEM careers; that the statistician’s alternative jobs are more palatable than the writer’s.

I find that people mix up net and gross a lot in these issues.

My understanding of Michael Pettis’s argument is that the US dollar would weaken, and thereby close the trade deficit, if it weren’t the global reserve currency.

Ie, if the excess US dollars resulting from the trade deficit were not parked in dollar-denominated assets, but instead exchanged for exported goods and services, then we’d have more dollars chasing the same quantity of production, causing the dollar to depreciate. This is the general understanding of how floating currency exchange rates prevent persistent trade imbalances.

Pettis (and Matt Klein) argue that the strong dollar benefits the US financial services industry, and related fields like venture-capital-financed tech, at the expense of US production. The strong demand for dollar-denominated assets provides massive fee revenue for financial services, and further keeps the cost of dollar-funded capital cheap. In contrast, the unnaturally strong dollar weakens US exports by making them more expensive on the international market."

That lazy and self-serving copout guards us from having to contend with the politics of the possible within a pluralistic democracy where many of our fellow voters disagree with us at a foundational level. We can instead pretend that the issue is just Tucker lying to his mass audience, and further believe we should simply focus on correcting that.

> There is one giant, obvious, international, and gendered cause: Social media. Instagram was founded in 2010. The iPhone 4 was released then too—the first smartphone with a front-facing camera. In 2012 Facebook bought Instagram, and that’s the year that its user base exploded. By 2015, it was becoming normal for 12-year-old girls to spend hours each day taking selfies, editing selfies, and posting them for friends, enemies, and strangers to comment on, while also spending hours each day scrolling through photos of other girls and fabulously wealthy female celebrities with (seemingly) vastly superior bodies and lives. The hours girls spent each day on Instagram were taken from sleep, exercise, and time with friends and family. What did we think would happen to them?

> The Collaborative Review doc that Jean Twenge, Zach Rausch and I have put together collects more than a hundred correlational, longitudinal, and experimental studies, on both sides of the question. Taken as a whole, it shows strong and clear evidence of causation, not just correlation.

My concern with Substack the business is that they raised capital at an insane valuation at the height of the 2021 tech VC mania, and they now appear to be struggling to grow into that valuation. In March 2021 they raised at a valuation of $650 million, [1] and they subsequently canceled an attempt to raise more money in May 2022 with a proposed valuation between $750m and $1b. [2] The following month they had to lay off 14% of their team. [3]

Substack now faces the intense challenge of growing into a valuation set during a tech mania after the investing environment has fundamentally shifted. With higher interest rates and skepticism around unprofitable tech firms, investors are demanding lower valuations for a given revenue/growth rate.

Yet is is generally considered suicide for start up to do a down round; to raise money at lower valuation than their previous round. Their previous round investors would have to mark a loss on their Substack investment and many of their employees would find their stock options to be worthless. There are financial tricks to avoid a down round, eg. liquidation preferences for new investors, but they are problematic in their own right.

To put some numbers on a potential valuation, Substack is now estimated to have an annualized run rate revenue of $24m given their announcement of 2 million paid subscriptions. [4] At their previous funding round with a valuation of $650m, that is a revenue multiple of 27. Historically, SaaS startups have a revenue multiple of around 10, and even with insane growth and margins it’s hard to go above 20. [5] Hence, they still have a ways to go in order to just grow into their current valuation, let alone raise at a higher valuation.

The fact that they attempted to raise a new round roughly a year after their previous round suggests they aren’t close to cash flow positive. Their 14% layoff likely just slows their burn rate to extend their current funding, and give them a chance to grow into their valuation.

But Substack’s current shareholder’s don’t want a small, profitable business. They’re venture-funded and VCs are looking for extreme outcomes; either a 10x return or a 0x return. These venture firms aren’t structured like traditional private equity to just own cash generating businesses. Further, the $650m valuation for just $24m of annual revenue is already effectively a 0x return as far as any investor is concerned. VCs would rather Substack continue to take some large risks rather than optimize the current business for profit.

If Substack should fail to raise additional funding and finally runs out of money, then VCs will pursue a sale. That could include a sale of the entire firm or individual assets. Someone might be willing to pay far less than $650m for the current business, particularly if the buyer is already in the industry or a related one. The purchaser can further optimize the profitability by eliminating redundant functions and incorporating Substack into their firm."

Twitter yesterday reported the service had 302 million Monthly Active Users (MAUs), an increase of only 18% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter (and the company said the current quarter would be worse!). This is a fraction of Facebook, half of Facebook Messenger, fewer than Instagram and not that much bigger than SnapChat; presuming the latter service passes Twitter later this year, Twitter will be only the 5th most popular U.S.-based social networking service looking to monetize through advertising. This distinction — which excludes WhatsApp, at least for now — is a critical one, because the issue with advertisers is most don’t have the time or ability to work with multiple services; it’s likely most digital advertising spending (which I believe is set to expand greatly) will be consolidated onto the biggest networks (along with Google’s properties), with Facebook taking the lion’s share. Were that to happen, it’s easy to see Twitter as the odd network out.

> The trouble for Twitter is that awareness of the service has long outstripped its usability. And yet, despite the fact that Twitter has struggled with new user growth for years, almost nothing was done to improve the product or on-boarding experience until just the last few months, when the company finally rolled out a new logged-out page meant to entice people with Twitter’s content, as well as an instant timeline that helped people get started.

Even if you’re not much of a sports fan, I highly recommend reading the linked article by Ben Thompson, “What the NBA Can Learn From Formula 1”, https://stratechery.com/2023/what-the-nba-can-learn-from-formula-1/

It’s a highly informative and entertaining piece about the history of the sports media business and the current challenges faced by every US sports franchise outside of the NFL, particularly the NBA. These leagues are ultimately victims of the broader disruptions in the media ecosystem as cord cutters are ditching cable for streaming services. The sports leagues, and their intermediaries like the regional sports networks had a great deal with the cable bundle and it’s not clear how they’ll survive without it.

Of particular concern is slow decline in viewership of these sports, and that will only accelerate due the failure to cultivate fandom among younger cohorts. Cable used to serve as something of a gateway drug that made it easy for anyone to become a casual fan, and for many of those to become diehard fans. With the younger generations ditching cable for streaming, that opportunity is lost.

Thompson contrasts that against the massive success of Formula 1 to grow a new fandom, including through the Netflix series “Drive to Survive”. The show is apparently part documentary and part reality TV (I’ve never seen it), and also highly accessible to non-fans since it’s on Netflix. Many attribute this series to the growing fandom of Formula 1. Thompson says that other sports franchises need to similarly adapt to the changing media ecosystem in order to nurture a new generation of fans."

Yet bundling allows us each to slightly subsidize products that we’re less excited about, some of which we still consume, and thereby get access to more media than we could afford a-la-carte.

I’m quoting the key text below, but you should just find it in the article because Substack comments don’t support list formatting and the article also includes helpful visuals,

> Imagine there are four products each delivered as a monthly subscription. We have a choice to deliver them each a-la-carte, or to produce a bundle across all of them. Now let’s divide the population for each good into 3 parts. Imagine that for each good, each prospective customer is one of these 3:
> 1, SuperFan: This is someone who fits two criteria:
> ** They would pay the a-la-carte price for the channel. This means that they are fairly far along the price elasticity curve for the good (perhaps to the inelastic point)
> ** They have the activation energy to seek out the good and purchase it.
> 2. CasualFan: Someone who would value the good if they had access to it, but lack one of the two SuperFan criteria ー either they aren’t willing to pay the a-la-carte price for the good, or don’t have the activation energy to seek it out, or both.
> 3. NonFan: Someone who will ascribe zero (or perhaps negative) value to having access to the good.
>
> If we offered these goods a-la-carte, then:
> * The providers would only provide service (and collect revenue) from their SuperFans (the blue highlights), and
> * Consumers would only have access to goods for which they are a SuperFan
>
> The a-la-carte model clearly doesn’t maximize value, as consumers are getting access to fewer goods than they might be interested in, and providers are only addressing part of their potential market.
> On the other hand, the bundled offer expands the universe and not only matches SuperFans with the products they are SuperFans of, but also allows for those consumers to get access to products of which they may be CasualFans. From a providers perspective, it gives access to consumers much beyond their natural SuperFan base. This is the heart of how bundles create value ー it’s not about addressing the SuperFan, it’s about allowing the CasualFan to participate."

Say we expect that a student should be able to pay off their degree within 5 years of graduation at a cost of at most 10% of disposable income. With those constraints, and historical data for earnings, we can work out the maximum borrowing limit for a given degree.

That would force exploitative programs, like Columbia’s 10-month journalism master’s degree for $70k, [1] to adapt or die. They either need to increase the financial value of the education to the student or massively cut the costs. If they can offer the program for $7k, great. Alternatively, maybe they can adapt the curriculum to substantially boost graduates' wages. Barring that, the program will be eliminated, or least disqualified for educational borrowing.

Yes, Thompson and Mehrotra’s argument is that many of these media endeavors aren’t economically viable without cross-subsidization. Within the bundle everyone pays a small amount for some stuff they wouldn’t otherwise buy, and also benefits from having their preferred content partially paid for by others.

For a specific media property, this solely benefits the CasualFans. They might be willing to pay $5/month to occasionally watch it, but there aren’t enough people—SuperFans and CasualFans combined—to fund the product. Higher prices would be needed, but that dissuades CasualFans from paying. There just doesn’t exist a price point at which enough people would pay for the product to make it viable. It can only work by forcing NonFans to pay up.

Yet everyone is a CasualFan of something in the bundle. Some sports fans might never watch a Disney’s child show but they have to pay for it, and thereby make it viable for the households with the opposing preferences. And vice versa.

Some products can work a-la-carte. Eg, Slow Boring. There likely exist subscribers that wouldn’t pay a penny more regardless of what was bundled in alongside, and they benefit from the current financial model. Other current non-subscribers might be willing to purchase a specific bundle with SB, and they would thereby benefit from the liberal technocratic indoctrination if such a package deal existed.

It ultimately comes down to the details of the bundle to determine how the economics work out for consumers and producers. Cable worked for decades, but that model is now faltering. Participants, particularly sports, need to find something new. "

> The brute reality is that most kids slot themselves into academic ability bands early in life and stay there throughout schooling. We have a certain natural level of performance, gravitate towards it early on, and are likely to remain in that band relative to peers until our education ends. There is some room for wiggle, and in large populations there are always outliers. But in thousands of years of education humanity has discovered no replicable and reliable means of taking kids from one educational percentile and raising them up into another. Mobility of individual students in quantitative academic metrics relative to their peers over time is far lower than popularly believed. The children identified as the smart kids early in elementary school will, with surprising regularity, maintain that position throughout schooling. Do some kids transcend (or fall from) their early positions? Sure. But the system as a whole is quite static. Most everybody stays in about the same place relative to peers over academic careers. The consequences of this are immense, as it is this relative position, not learning itself, which is rewarded economically and socially in our society."

Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein have long argued that the German system keeps wages artificially low in order to maintain export competitiveness. My rough understanding is that there is an unholy alliance between government, corporations, and unions—all backed by the popular will of the German people—to pursue this policy, motivated by the economic pain that they experienced during the German reunification in the 90s. 

Here’s a 2018 article from Pettis that elaborates on the general problem of mercantilist policies for export competitiveness, including Germany’s situation, “High Wages Versus High Savings in a Globalized World”, https://carnegieendowment.org/chinafinancialmarkets/75972

> Germany’s experience of reducing wages during this century illustrates the problem by showing how the process worked in reverse. For over a decade, Germany suffered from high unemployment as its producers were priced out of the market by foreign competitors. In 2003–2004, Berlin implemented a number of labor reforms—referred to as the Hartz reforms—whose net impact was to weaken the bargaining power of workers and substantially slow wage growth to well below GDP growth. When this happened, Germany’s trade deficit became one of the largest surpluses in history as its unemployment level fell sharply. In a globalized world, the way to gain competitiveness is to reduce the real value of wages, either by reducing nominal wages (as Germany did), or by undervaluing the currency (as many Asian countries do)."

Couldn’t grow their loan book quick enough to match their massive increase in deposits as venture capital exploded in 2021.

If you got time, Matt Levine has the best, and most entertaining explanation in, “Startup Bank Had a Startup Bank Run”, https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-10/startup-bank-had-a-startup-bank-run

> If you were the Bank of Startups, the main service that you provided to startups is that equity investors would give them a truck full of cash and they’d deposit it at your bank. 
> People kept flinging money at SVB’s customers, and they kept depositing it at SVB. Perfectly reasonable banking service. 
> But the customers didn’t need loans, in part because equity investors kept giving them trucks full of cash and in part because young tech startups tend not to have the fixed assets or recurring cash flows that make for good corporate borrowers. … [T]here is a basic imbalance. Customer money keeps coming in, as deposits, but it doesn’t go out, as loans.
> So you have all this customer cash, and you need to do something with it. Keeping it in, like, Fed reserves, or Treasury bills, in 2021, was not a great choice; that stuff paid basically no interest, and you want to make money. So you’d buy longer-dated, but also very safe, securities, things like Treasury bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities.
> As Armstrong puts it, SVB had “a double sensitivity to higher interest rates. On the asset side of the balance sheet, higher rates decrease the value of those long-term debt securities. On the liability side, higher rates mean less money shoved at tech, and as such, a lower supply of cheap deposit funding.”"

First, I suspect the FDIC and associated government agencies will work quickly and diligently to stabilize the situation. It’s possible a full acquisition of SVB will be announced soon, with a major bank taking over all assets and obligations. Worst case, the FDIC will make the insured sums available Monday morning and likely provide additional initial recovers this week. The depositors will continue to receive funds and could be made 90% whole within weeks.

On the moral hazard front, the 250k FDIC limit is well known. Mature business manages this with treasury operations where funds are dispersed across checking accounts at multiple banks, money market funds, and government bonds. For small and medium businesses there are turnkey solutions provided by financial services companies, including major banks, for easily managing treasury operations. Eg, automatic daily sweeping of funds beyond 250k out of checking accounts and into money markets.

Many startups ignore the risks associated with forgoing treasury management because that is just one of the numerous risks that can kill a startup before it matures into an actual ongoing concern. Eg, a major tech firm announcing a competing product or a change in the regulatory environment. The biggest risk is that the startup simply fails to ever develop a product with sufficient customer demand to create a viable business. Until that risk is sufficiently addressed, it just isn’t worth the time to manage the dozens of other risks that can kill a startup.

Further, many startups banked at SVB because it offered additional financial services beneficial to startups. That includes startup lending that required them to keep their funds at SVB. The startups implicitly took on the risk of forgoing treasury operations as the price of accessing these services. That may have been an acceptable business decision, but the government shouldn’t bail them out for this knowable risk.

It will certainly suck for the impacted startups. Yet a startup isn’t much more than a series of crises with occasional moments of joyous accomplishments. Their current SVB woes is a relatively simple problem to address since at most they simply need some short term financing until sufficient funds are recovered by the FDIC. This is something that their existing investors should immediately provide since those funds can be repaid with low risk. Some investors may use this as an opportunity to wind down the startup, but those were likely already on the verge of collapse anyways.

Going forward, more startups may choose to pay the expense in time and money to implement basic treasury operations, possibly at the demand of their investors. Or at least keep their funds at a JP Morgan."

The critics will be proven right in their argument that the US government is an inefficient and ineffective capital allocator.

The US already has massive structural disadvantages in chip manufacturing. I’ve repeatedly seen this Dec 2022 WSJ article about TSMC’s struggles to create an Arizona plant [1] cited as proof that we’ve largely lost the capacity to build and operate these facilities.

> High costs, lack of trained personnel and unexpected construction snags are among the issues cited by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. as it rushes to get the north Phoenix factory ready to start production in December 2023.
> TSMC executives have said it isn’t easy to recreate in America the manufacturing ecosystem they have built over decades in Taiwan, drawing on local engineering talent and a network of suppliers including many in East Asia. Mr. Chang said the cost of making chips in Arizona may be at least 50% higher than in Taiwan.
> [TSMC in letter to the Commerce Department listed six problems that have emerged], including federal regulatory requirements, “unexpected work developments” during construction and additional site preparation, all of which it said raised costs.

So further increasing the cost and regulatory burden on deploying CHIPS funds only further exacerbates our structural deficits in chips manufacturing. If anything we should’ve gone the opposite direction in removing regulatory hurdles. Eg, exempted them from NEPA review and immigration quotas. Rather than chaining them to overly-expensive domestically sourced materials, equipment, and labor, the firms should be incentivized to make economically rational decisions regardless of the source (excluding China dependencies).

Hence, I worry that in 10 years we’ll all look back on the CHIPS Act as accomplishing little at a high expense, and thereby proof that the US government shouldn’t take an active role in industrial interventions.

Intel is even using TSMC to manufacture some chips as it struggles to reorganize itself. [1]

Intel is now in a do-or-die attempt to separate its design and manufacturing, hoping that its manufacturing arm will eventually become competitive with TSMC for outside customers. [2] Should that fail, it will go the way of AMD and rely entirely on TSMC for future production. Just like AMD’s Global Foundry spinout, Intel’s manufacturing division will be sold so that it can focus on lower-margin, older generation architectures to extract some value while it slowly wound down.

The tech analyst Ben Thompson has been following Intel’s struggle and warning about its inevitable slow decline since 2013. [3] His Jan 2022 article, “The Intel Split”, covers a bit of the history about how Intel became complacent, notably its miss of mobile. Mobile chip architecture has matured and is now moving into the datacenter (Intel’s cherished turf) due to superior energy efficiency and lower costs. Thompson goes on to describe the necessary gamble that Intel is taking in separating design and manufacturing, as well as the risks involved. 

And now Intel’s recent earnings show that its revenue and margins are dropping faster than they forecast. [4] Hence its runway to complete this reorganization is shortening. In contrast, the fabless AMD’s recent earnings and forecasts are improving. [5] So it won’t be long before investors demand that Intel exit manufacturing if it can’t soon demonstrate some success in their reorganization strategy.

And higher costs, lower profits matters. It will limit both the results of public funds and the extent to which private funds crowd in. If all we get out of the CHIPS Act is a few exorbitantly expensive to build and unprofitable fabs, then it will be seen as a waste. "

I think many of us are far more interested in reading and discussing social issues like poverty than we are in actually addressing these problems. Doubly so if it would come at a personal cost to us affluent wanna-be noble aristocrats. We simply enjoy the thrill of applying our thinking and sophistry in something of a status game where we cosplay as philosophers. A hundred years ago we’d likely be arguing about the interpretation of scripture in our application of the Social Gospel, without much need to actually apply anything.

I think a lot of this comes down to us misdiagnosing a persuasion problem as a political problem.

We just don’t yet have substantial consensus that we Americans should pay higher taxes to reduce child poverty. Yes, almost everyone agrees that child poverty is bad and should be addressed. Even many Republican voters and politicians agree. But when personal sacrifice in the form of higher taxes is added to the proposal, we recoil in discomfort. We simply can’t address child poverty through politics until we’ve persuaded a sufficient number of fellow Americans to support this policy.

And yet we progressives deny the nature of the problem before us. We want to believe that our ideas are already broadly popular, or that we can eliminate personal sacrifice with some nebulous concept of “tax the rich.” Some of this may be our own unacknowledged selfishness. Some of it may be a lack of seriousness at actually addressing the problem.

But the biggest cause in my opinion is our lack of convictions in the power of our beliefs. We can’t even consider the possibility our ideas may be unpopular because that could suggest that we are wrong. We also don’t want to do the hard and dirty missionary work of converting others to our faith. That would require empathy for nonbelievers and a concerted effort to meet them where they are at as we spread the good word.

Yet I’m actually optimistic that the situation will improve because our ideas are strong, just, and persuasive. We’ll probably need a bit more pain before we’re forced to recon with the cold hard reality. Ultimately the power of our beliefs will compel us to do so."

The Fed is preparing a report about its supervision of SVB for release by May 1st. [1] Until we have those details, I don’t think we should speculate too much about regulatory failures, including the impact of the 2018 Trump deregulation. It just feels too convenient to pin these failures on Trump, and I worry that could misguide us towards future reforms. Specifically, repealing those deregulations may be insufficient.

Notably, many of SVB’s problems could be gleaned entirely from public fillings. Eg, here’s a Jan 18th 2023 Twitter thread from an SVB short seller that has subsequently gotten a lot of attention for being prescient. [2] Some excerpts 

> $SIVB's big problems are with its HTM portfolio
> The bank basically increased its security portfolio by 700% at a generational TOP in the bond market, buying $88 b of mostly 10+ year mortgages with an average yield of just 1.63% at Sept 30th.  Oops!  4/1
> The risk for $SIVB is that deposit outflows accelerate at such a pace that it is forced to either raise equity capital and/or sell down its HTM securities portfolio, thus realizing substantial losses. You can bet that $SIVB is praying for a Fed pivot!

And there are plenty more examples of investors and analysts worrying about regional banks throughout 2022 as rates rose rapidly. Not necessarily predicting total failures, just being deeply stressed and needing to raise capital on draconian terms.

So bank examiners could certainly have known of SVB’s challenges. The question we’ll learn from the Fed report is just how much did they know, and what actions did they take. Were there cases where regulators were limited by deregulation? What tools would they need for both earlier diagnosis and forcing action on a bank?

WSJ seems to have the best reporting about why SBV was saved via this mechanism in the Mar 16 article, “Why Top Washington Officials Chose to Rescue SVB, Signature Depositors”. [1] It appears that the main concern was a general panic and run on many local and regional banks across the country if there was any uncertainty about SBV depositors being made whole. Eg, any insured deposits across the country would flee these other smaller banks. That would kick off many more bank failures and a large scale financial crisis.

Ideally, FDIC would’ve found an acquirer bank over the weekend to assume SBV’s liabilities, and that was attempted, but ultimately failed. On Monday, FDIC could have paid out as much as 50% of the uninsured deposits, but additional recovery could take months. Even if SBV depositors were eventually made 100% whole, the long period of uncertainty would sow fear and panic among other uninsured depositors at other local and regional banks.

The systemic-risk exception was the only mechanism the government had to quickly resolve this uncertainty, and thereby manage the broader bank run risks. Some excerpts from the WSJ piece.

> Ms. Brainard and others made the case that depositors at other midsize banks like SVB could pull out their deposits on Monday, precipitating a bank run across the country that could endanger billions in deposits. They also feared that the loss of deposits at SVB could leave startups that banked with SVB and even other regionals without the cash to meet payroll this week. 

> Officials at the Fed monitored real-time data showing a growing pile of withdrawal requests.  

> Regulators had considered telling uninsured depositors that they could access at least 50% of their deposits as early as Monday, but after Signature’s failure and other stresses became clear, they decided that would be insufficient. By Saturday morning, Ms. Yellen had concluded that a blanket guarantee of SVB bank deposits would be needed. Ms. Brainard shared Ms. Yellen’s assessment of the developments over the weekend.  

> By Sunday afternoon, the four top overseers concluded that they had no choice but to invoke the systemic-risk exception and promise all depositors they would be able to access their money at SVB and Signature.

Odd Lots interviewed Columbia Law School professor Lev Menand about banking regulation history and SBV yesterday. [1] His main point was that banking regulators already have a lot of discretion by statute to reign in bad banking behavior. Menand argues that they’ve forgone using that discretion, and instead rely on weaker and rigid procedural based enforcement.

Nonetheless, Menand believes the bank deregulation contributed to the SVB collapse.

> The result was that they didn't have stress testing, which is the primary means by which supervisors now exercise substantive judgment about risks. You had a much more light touch, process-focused oversight that allowed rule-compliant balance sheet configurations like SVB's to go relatively unchallenged. If they had been in the enhanced prudential standards bucket, they would have been challenged through additional rules and supervisory programs. It's unlikely, though you can never know, that they could have taken so much duration risk and not raised capital earlier or been permitted to go for so long in a position where their liquidation value is possibly negative.

In contrast, a WSJ opinion piece argues that, “Stress Testing Wouldn’t Have Saved Silicon Valley Bank.” [2]

> But even if midsize banks had been subjected to the same scrutiny as large banks, it isn’t clear that stress testing them would have led to changes that would have prevented failure. Why? Because the tests asked the wrong questions. They failed to encompass the scenarios that ultimately led to SVB’s demise—large and rapid increases in interest rates.
> In its February 2022 Stress Test Scenarios, the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” asked banks to assess their riskiness over a three-year horizon in a hypothetical world in which the three-month Treasury rate stays near zero while the 10-year Treasury yield declines to 0.75% during the first quarter of 2022 and doesn’t change in the subsequent two quarters. Even in December 2021, however, the Federal Open Market Committee’s Summary of Economic Projections was showing the Fed likely targeting interest rates double those of 2022 in 2023, far higher than what it used for bank stress tests.

So I think we still need to learn more about the details of SVB’s regulation leading up to their failure. We’ll get that by May 1st when the Fed releases their report on SVB regulation. [3]

Pleasantly surprised by its results:

The comments cover a variety of topics ranging from politics, history, social issues, personal preferences, and current events. One theme that arises is the importance of being strategic in addressing political opponents. One comment argues that opposing Republican politicians on social issues and cruelty only validates their electoral strategy, and instead suggests focusing on their vulnerabilities on issues such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, and banking regulation. Another comment echoes this sentiment, arguing that it is ineffective to use performative denunciation as a strategy, as it often plays into the hands of trolls and results in people looking ridiculous. 

The debate on Daylight Saving Time (DST) also surfaces, with some arguing that people's preferences are often influenced by their work and social schedules. Furthermore, the impact of DST varies depending on geographic location and local conditions, such as when the sunrise occurs relative to when people need to wake up. 

The discussion on the 1619 Project focuses on the diverging views of history, with some arguing that it is optimistic in its attempts to forge a moral identity centered on progress and liberation, while others criticize it for being historically inaccurate and selectively informed. 

The comments also touch on the issue of how to deal with future bank failures and runs, particularly in the age of instant communication and social media. While some suggest indemnifying the buyer as a solution, others highlight the need to consider the timing of failures and the potential for misinformation or correct information to spread quickly. 

Overall, the comments reflect the complexity of different issues and the need for nuanced discussions and strategies to address them."

As a software engineer, I think AI-augmented coding is just a continuation of a multi-decade trend in which we use increasingly powerful tools to abstract away technical challenges and common tasks. Notably, modern programming languages look more like English than those used in the 80s. And w/ SaaS and cloud infrastructure we can programmatically outsource tons of work. This not only makes the field more approachable, but also gives us massive leverage in applying software; a single engineer can now do the work that would’ve previously taken a dozen. 

The economics of software engineering could certainly reach an inflection point and reverse, but so far compensation has only increased as we’ve gotten more powerful tools."

As a software engineer, I feel that programming has already been largely commodified for at least a decade in that the mass majority of programmers are not solving technical problems, but instead are solving the social problem of, “exactly what should the software service or product do?” Once that has been figured out, the actual design and implementation is rarely much of a challenge.

This is the result of modern programming tools—notably compilers and runtimes, which are themselves computer programs—becoming sufficiently powerful to abstract away all of the technical challenges. For example, until well into the 80s most software engineers spent a substantial amount of time solving the problem of, “how will my program manage memory?”. Ie, how to use RAM. This is a hard engineering problem that not only drastically affects program performance, but also an error prone area where a single mistake could crash the program, or worse create security vulnerabilities.

Decades of computer science research and engineering has resulted in modern programming tools that totally abstract away memory management. Now the mass majority of programmers needn’t ever concern themselves with this hard technical problem. Numerous other advances in programming tools have similarly freed developers from previous technical challenges. Further, we now also have a plethora of reusable components in the form of code libraries and standardized software services (eg, software-as-a-service and cloud infrastructure) that we can leverage to abstract away almost any conceivable technical problem.

AI programming tools continue that trend, yet someone still has to figure out the specific intended behavior of the software service or product to an excruciating level of detail. I think this could be illustrated with an analogy to lawyers writing legal contracts. Lawyers can already draw from a large library of reference (or template) contracts from previous similar situations. In many cases these can be largely reused with minor modification. This is comparable to how programming can use existing libraries and services.

AI can certainly automate the drafting of contracts or computer code when the situation is sufficiently novel that reuse isn’t appropriate. Yet a practitioner still has to verify all of the details and make revisions to ensure intended behavior when executed in a court or computer. In programming, most of the time is spent figuring out what these details with a high degree of specificity through discussions with stakeholders, including end users or their representatives.

So while AI will likely substantially increase programming productivity, it is just a continuation of a trend. Even in the absence of AI programming tools, I think the field has been substantially commodified to the point that many, if not most, people could be a programmer. And the main challenge of determining intended software behavior at a high-level of detail still remains."

There is also a political reason why the Fed, Treasury, and Congress are deeply concerned about community and regional bank failures: those banks have an incredible amount of political pull. Possibly even more than the big banks. Every congressional district has local banks, and the leaders of those banks are deeply enmeshed in the business and political community. Eg, serve on the chamber of commerce, make loans to local businesses, and work with community political organizers. Hence anything that could harm these smaller banks (eg, the current deposit flight or regulation) gets the attention of Congress and thereby the rest of the government."

I think this is contentious because the cranks ignore all of the constraints on bank money creation, and then use that misunderstanding to justify conspiracy theories or to shill crypto/gold. There is a ton of regulation on bank balance sheets, and that limits their ability to originate loans. The naive explanation that banks simply loan out deposits is in many ways a decent approximation of lending capacity in that deposits are the primary funding source for bank balance sheets."

To illustrate this, imagine a new bank that starts by taking $100 in deposits and it holds them as $100 of reserves at the central bank. Its liabilities (deposits) and its assets (reserves) perfectly balance. It can originate a new $10 loan, which entails creatings $10 of deposits in the borrower's account, and the loan itself is a new asset that has a repayment value of $10, as well as series of interest payments.

Let's assume that the bank values the loan as an $11 asset on its books. The bank now has $111 of assets ($100 of reserves and $11 loan), as well as $110 of liabilities ($100 original deposits and $10 of new deposits). Its assets exceed liabilities by $1.

Next, say that the borrower withdraws the $10 loan to make a purchase. The bank funds that out of reserves at the central bank; either exchanging it for currency or transferring the reserves to another bank that holds the account of the seller. The bank now has $100 deposit liabilities and $101 of assets ($90 of reserves and the $11 loan).

There is a ton of regulation around the bank's balance sheet; its assets vs liabilities. For one, this example is an oversimplification because the bank’s assets always need to exceed its liabilities by a margin called equity buffer. Eg, it may need to start with $10 of the bank's own money, raised by investors, before it could even accept $100 of deposits. That would give it $100 of deposit liabilities against $110 of assets such that it has a 10% equity buffer."

Eg, prevent the SVB situation of large investment losses. We’d essentially want banks to primarily park their funds at the Fed as reserves and also invest in short-duration government bonds. That would curtail lending, the other side of banking, which is not necessarily a bad thing as I elaborate on below.

First, I think we should reconsider the fundamental question: what role do we want banks to play in our financial system? Historically, we wanted them to intermediate saving and lending, particularly managing the duration mismatch between deposits and loans. Deposits can be withdrawn at any time, whereas loans take years to pay back. We also wanted banks to manage credit risk; to accurately predict default risk and charge appropriate rates to compensate for that.

Yet there are now numerous alternatives to bank lending. Eg, anyone can buy a mortgage-backed securities ETF to contribute funding for home loans. Securitization has been applied to almost every asset class, with numerous variants within each class, each having different risk/reward profiles. And these can be packaged into fixed-income funds that diversify across asset classes. For more esoteric assets, such as small business loans, specialized private capital funds can evaluate and invest accordingly.

In all of these cases, the savers are more directly exposed to the investment risks, which on average should give them more upside. For extreme safety, one can put funds into a federal money market mutual fund with virtually zero risk of loss. For more yield, one can take on some credit or duration risk. Beyond that, one can choose equity (ie, stocks) over debt investments for more long term upside.

So what do we need banks for? Could they just serve us in providing easy access to small amounts of highly liquid funds? Might we want to discourage larger deposits since we no longer need them for intermediating saving and lending?"

Everyone wants to believe in some concept of community, people tied together in meaningful interdependence. Yet our revealed preference is that we mainly want to get away from each other.

Our desire for connectivity is likely largely based on the benefits, particularly being able to rely on others.

This stance makes me empathize with the Republican criticism of teacher unions. Coupled with the numerous issues surrounding police unions, my apprehension towards public sector unions as a whole grows.

Public sector unions appear to be fundamentally different from their private sector counterparts. This difference may stem from the fact that private sector unions must navigate the competitive landscape while striving to preserve the well-being of the companies employing their members. Conversely, public sector unions enjoy a secure, captive customer base in taxpayers, owing to the monopolistic nature of public services. Consequently, they might be inclined to work with the political system to secure excessive profits in a parasitic, rent-seeking fashion.

Unions seem to function best when they perceive themselves as part of a symbiotic relationship with employers, competing against other firms. A prime example is the German model, which emphasizes international competitiveness. When private sector unions lobby for policies that undermine competition, such as protectionist measures, they become similarly parasitic. Conversely, public sector unions at the city and state level could recognize the long-term risk of taxpayers moving to rival jurisdictions and focus on excelling in that contest by providing high-quality services efficiently and sustainably.

The education-centered culture war is particularly detrimental because it undermines public support for education as a whole. Universal school choice, however, would allow voters to hold diverse views on education.

Parents can make mistakes, including extreme mistakes that permanently damage their children. These mistakes can fall on either end of a spectrum, such as those who give their children too much freedom as well as those who give too little. Yet ultimately, parents almost universally care far more about their children than society as a whole, and further they know their children better than anyone else.

It is paramount that we popularize this cynical explanation. Republicans must believe that AI regulation is merely a desperate act of self-preservation from us ""white collar liberal elites.""

And best of all, Apple is heavily incentivized to nurture and protect open source AI models.

I am concerned that this move may be a last-ditch effort to sustain a struggling startup after being turned down by venture capitalists. Substack is currently raising funds at a $585 million valuation, which represents a 25x multiple of its **revenue**. This is based on the platform's estimated annualized revenue run rate of $24 million. [1] This valuation appears quite generous, even in a zero interest rate environment, and especially considering the current macroeconomic climate.

For some background, Substack's previous funding round took place in March 2021, when the company was valued at $650 million during the peak of tech investment frenzy. [1] In May 2022, the platform abandoned an effort to raise additional funds at a proposed valuation of between $750 million and $1 billion. [3] The following month, Substack was forced to lay off 14% of its workforce. [4]

Given these circumstances, it seems likely that neither their existing VC investors nor new ones are willing to inject further capital into Substack, considering the platform's bleak prospects for becoming cash flow positive in the foreseeable future. As a result, the company appears to be turning to unsophisticated investors in a bid to prolong its survival and, perhaps, revamp its business model to regain the interest of venture capitalists.

In Nov 2021, they reported that just their top 10 writers earned $20 million/year. [1] Assuming no growth in earnings for the current top 10, that is still roughly 10% of their total revenue today. It's likely a higher percentage since the subscriber base of the current top 10 writers is probably larger than in 2021.

These whales necessitate a high-touch sales model, e.g., account managers and sales executives who can dedicate substantial time to individual writers. This includes negotiating upfront commitments (e.g., Slow Boring's first-year guarantee of $250k). It wouldn't surprise me if they also negotiated lower fees for larger sites because these large sites could leave Substack for their own custom site, as The Dispatch did last year. It even appears that Substack did some custom development work for Bari Weiss's The Free Press to give them a unique website.

This high-touch sales approach is labor-intensive. Moreover, they also want to develop a low-touch, self-onboarding workflow for smaller writers. This requires developing, maintaining, and operating a significant amount of automation. As a result, they need a sizable labor force, and tech workers are expensive. In June 2022, they had 81 employees after layoffs. [2] Assuming $250k/worker total cost, including benefits, employer payroll taxes, office space, etc., that would bring us to around their estimated $20m revenue. So, a rough estimate is that they spend all their revenue on personnel alone.

Lastly, venture capital isn't merely interested in a small, profitable business. They make all their returns on a small number of startups that each yield billions. They simply don't have the time or expertise to oversee small successful businesses. Instead, they want startups to aim high and be prepared to accept total failure. On the other hand, if they hadn't taken VC funds, they could have just operated as a smaller, yet profitable business. However, it's debatable whether they would have gained any significant traction without VC funds, especially to pay for the first-year guarantees of famous writers.

Write as if you were a conservative journalist at the New York Times.

Title: A Conservative's Case for the Merits of Traditionalist Mores

As a conservative journalist at the New York Times, I often find myself defending traditionalist mores in the face of progressive backlash. While it may seem like a fruitless endeavor to some, I believe that even the most ardent progressives can appreciate the value of traditionalist mores when approached with an open mind.

Firstly, traditionalist mores can offer a sense of stability and continuity in an ever-changing world. Progressives, who often champion change, can find solace in knowing that there are certain unchanging principles that have withstood the test of time. The consistency of traditional values can provide a stable foundation for personal growth, and even progressive ideals can be grounded in the wisdom of the past.

Secondly, traditionalist mores emphasize the importance of family and community. In an increasingly individualistic society, the focus on communal responsibility and interdependence can foster a more inclusive and empathetic environment. Though progressives may disagree with some specific tenets of traditional family values, the underlying message of care and support for one's family and community is universal.

Furthermore, traditionalist mores encourage personal responsibility and self-discipline. The progressive movement tends to focus on systemic issues and social justice, but it is important to remember that individual actions also play a crucial role in building a better society. By acknowledging the value of personal responsibility, progressives can cultivate a more well-rounded approach to societal change.

Additionally, traditionalist mores often prioritize long-term thinking over short-term gains. This mindset can complement progressive goals, as sustainable change requires a thoughtful consideration of the consequences of our actions. By embracing the traditionalist emphasis on prudence and foresight, progressives can strengthen their strategies for tackling complex issues like climate change and income inequality.

Lastly, traditionalist mores can serve as a cultural touchstone that unites people from diverse backgrounds. While progressives may see traditionalism as exclusionary, it can also be a source of shared values and understanding that transcends cultural and ideological differences. By recognizing the unifying potential of traditionalist mores, progressives can foster a more inclusive and collaborative society.

In conclusion, though traditionalist mores and progressive values may seem to be at odds, they can actually coexist in a mutually beneficial way. By considering the merits of traditionalism, progressives can develop a more balanced and well-rounded approach to societal change. It is only through open-mindedness and a willingness to engage with opposing viewpoints that we can create a more just and inclusive world."

It’s just that, by definition, stuff that generates a lot of eyeballs ends up proliferating.

The tech analyst Ben Thompson has been repeatedly harping this point for a decade. The internet has fundamentally disrupted the business model of journalism. And it’s not just eliminating outlets, but also radically restructuring the incentives of those that endure. In an evolutionary process, the internet has served as a massive environmental shock to journalism, and the institutions that have adapted and survived are fundamentally different from anything that came before.

For some background and history of the change, I’d recommend Thompson’s 2015 article, “Popping the Publishing Bubble”, https://stratechery.com/2015/popping-the-publishing-bubble/

> The shift from paper to digital meant publications could now reach every person on earth (not just their geographic area), and starting a new publication was vastly easier and cheaper than before. This had two critical implications:
> * There was now an effectively unlimited amount of ad inventory, which meant the price of an undifferentiated ad has drifted inexorably towards zero
> * “Readers” and “potential customers” became two distinct entities, which meant that publishers and advertisers were no longer in alignment
> This first point is obvious and well-known, but the importance of the second can not be overstated: publishers had long taken advertising for granted (or, as the journalists put it, had erected a “separation of church and state”) under the assumption they had a monopoly on reader attention. The increase in competition destroyed the monopoly, but it was the divorce of “readers” from “potential customers” that prevented even the largest publishers from profiting much from the massive amounts of new traffic they were receiving. After all, advertisers don’t really care about readers; they care about identifying, reaching, and converting potential customers.

The importance of this point cannot be overstated. Reductionism obscures more than it enlightens for both neural networks and the human brain. While both can be reduced to elemental operations—be it digital 1s and 0s or neurons and synapses—we have no clue how that gives rise to the fascinating emergent behavior.

I believe that is why so many techies, myself included, have become enchanted with the recent advances in AI. While previous generations of statistical learning had similarly opaque structures, the resulting behavior was exceedingly simple and domain specific. However, with the advent of cutting-edge AI, we now have machines that are able to replicate human-like abilities, particularly in their language processing capabilities. The potential implications of this development are staggering, and it is no wonder that so many of us are fascinated by the possibilities.

Moreover, this technology is not only readily accessible but also provides immediate and significant value. Whereas crypto, and even the early internet, had early advocates making grand promises, those two technologies required the development of network effects to unlock their full value. Crypto failed to achieve that and is now dying, and the internet took nearly two decades to become generally valuable to the broader population.

In contrast, anyone can easily try out ChatGPT or Github Copilot and get instant value. The immense productivity gains for tech workers are staggering and that leaves us in something of a shell shocked haze after our first encounter. It just takes us a bit to come to terms with the implications for how we’ll need to adapt to wield the massive leverage provided by AI."

Copilot is particularly powerful as it can comprehend an existing codebase and use that to provide suggestions while developers are writing code. Eg, I start defining a function and it suggests 10 lines of code that are nearly perfect from the partial function name alone. It is eerily prescient in how it can get ahead of your own thinking and basically complete your own seemingly sophisticated thoughts.

For writing, I think we’ll have to wait for Microsoft Office Copilot 365, which is currently just in beta. Similar to its GitHub cousin, it can learn concepts from your existing documents, as well as those shared by your coworkers. I've also heard it can pick up on a user's writing style and tone. Here is a short demo that you might initially find unbelievable, but I assure you that functionality is consistent with Copilot for code, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7xTBa93TX8

I’m particularly excited about how autocomplete can interact with chat. Eg, Github Copilot is developing a chat bot that can answer questions about code like, “Am I missing any edge cases in my unit tests for this module?” Or in writing, “Suggest a way that I could rewrite these paragraphs to use clearer and more concise language.”

Worse, I believe you’ll find that attacking me only leads me to sympathize with your opponents.

For example, you and I may both believe these AI systems are unexpectedly powerful in that we’ve never before seen a computer exhibit such human-like language capabilities.

Everyone agrees that current AI systems can hallucinate false information and that limits their usefulness. By starting with our mutual understandings, we can build trust and rapport.

Hence, I don’t think elite education is much of an advantage in the interview, at least at the earlier stage of the interviewing process. It’s possible that an elite school may push a candidate with marginal phone screening results on to the next stage, but that is about it.

In general, the tech industry invests a lot into the interview process because we cannot trust degrees, regardless of school, to be a strong signal of capability. There are weak candidates from Stanford CS and amazing ones from colleges we’ve never heard of. There are even plenty of solid engineers who are self taught, either without a degree or an unrelated one.

With pensions, taxpayers pay today for services that cops and firefighters and teachers performed years ago. 

Defined benefit pensions need to be eliminated. They just have too many bad incentives for firms, governments, and their employees. Employers are tempted to reduce short-term costs, including taxes for governments, by assuming these long-term liabilities. Worse, they can downplay the costs of that liability with overly optimistic projections of future growth and investment returns. That leads them to underinvest in their pension funds today. When the bill finally comes due, the firm or government can be crushed by the need to divert current revenue to these past liabilities.

In contrast, defined contributions force firms and governments to pay the bill today. Workers have incentives to project realistic or conservative investment returns, ensuring adequate funding. They're also liberated from their past employer's fiscal future. Although the economy could collapse, causing retirement accounts to provide lower returns, no firm or government can guarantee defined benefits in such scenarios.

Regulating AI is a fool’s errand. Namely because there’s already been extremely fast progress in the development of open source AI models that can run on consumer grade hardware, including both image generation [1] and large language models. [2] Ie, anyone can spend a few thousand dollars on a graphics card and start using these tools independently. These methods will only improve in capabilities, while hardware gets cheaper and more powerful, and thereby becoming incredibly available to run locally for anyone with a computer or phone.

Yes, we can limit their application in regulated industries by reputable firms. Ie, we can prevent chatbots from answering medical questions, despite the fact they are already as accurate as doctors. [3] But we’re not gonna stop deepfakes nor spam bots since unscrupulous actors will just ignore these regulations.

Worse, these regulations will impede our best chance at finally triumphing over the insidious grip of Baumol's cost disease. Eg, AI medical chatbots will greatly cut down on costs, expanding access while improving quality and consistency. There are numerous opportunities for us to finally perform capital-labor substitution in services using AI and thereby drastically reduce costs.

Ultimately, adaptation is our only option for managing AI advancements. We cannot stop bad actors, but instead we’ll need to adjust our own behavior to mitigate their harm. Eg, put zero trust in images, audio, and video that isn’t directly reported by reputable sources. Further, people will seek out unregulated AI tools should regulation prevent better options. Eg, people will locally run open source medical advice chatbots as that becomes increasingly trivial, in order to easily access valuable advice that they couldn’t otherwise obtain. We should prefer that large reputable firms navigate the challenges of these new AI tools rather than fully deferring to the global open source community at large.

Founders want to avoid such a down round and Substack is instead fleecing unsophisticated investors to maintain their previous valuation."

They certainly could have, and SHOULD HAVE, released 2022. The articles discusses alternatives for the firm.

Both Meléndez-Sánchez and the El Faro article highlight how this has left the gangs in disarray. Typically, we wouldn’t expect this to be possible; the incentives are just too strong for prison administration to resist. Bribes are not only highly lucrative, but violence can also be threatened against anyone (and their family) who refuses. Ie, “plata o plomo”: “silver or lead.”

While neither article can explain how El Salvador has pulled off the impossible, this strategy of isolating leadership certainly seems like something that could be repeated elsewhere, particularly in countries with more robust institutions. Eg, gang leaders could be assigned a mandatory one or two years of solitary confinement and be housed in particularly well-resourced prisons with numerous checks on corruption.

Of course we’d expect gangs to adapt with more robust intermediary layers of management. The Salvadoran case of highly concentrated leadership already seems unusual, and going forward we’d expect them to establish more resilient middle management.

Nonetheless, a crackdown on gang leadership with rigorous prison isolation looks to be a promising policy."

Yet, we the voters are irrational and can be swayed by the vibes that a president or senator exudes on this local matter. Particularly when there was a highly salient broader debate on the general issue of crime and policing in 2020.

I think this is why many federal-level Republicans, notably Trump, attempted to campaign on this issue despite their lack of any policy proposals. They were just engaging with the national dialectic on crime and policing. Further, this was compounded by several notable local-level Democratic politicians practicing messaging and policies that could be interpreted as hostile to the police at a time when crime was spiking. And several prominent federal-level Democratic politicians, as well as Democrat-aligned national pundits, expressed support for those local efforts.

None of this should’ve risen to federal-level politics. But we the people, both as voters and media consumers, heavily engaged with the topic at that level. And I can’t blame any politicians (even Trump!) for responding to these incentives."

So when parents choose private schools they appear to consistently do so for non-academic reasons. Eg, religious indoctrination. While that is obviously bad for these parents' children, could it not also be a net positive for the remaining students because it minimizes the meddling of these parents in the public school system? For example, the parents that attend school board meetings to complain and yell about “woke” instruction.

Hence, I’m reluctantly willing to support some school choice because it could lead to de-escalation of the culture war fights around education. Almost all parents care about the education of their children and some care in a deeply irrational and strongly passionate fashion. Giving these parents an exit option so that they become someone else's problem could be an improvement for the public school system."

Like if we removed the students with the relatively most engaged parents from an already poorly performing school district, would that somehow make things even worse for the remaining students? If so, what is the proposed mechanism? Eg, it will be even harder to recruit teachers.

And even if it does diminish the academic outcomes for the most disadvantaged, I still think we need to balance that against the counterfactual outcomes for the students that would’ve exited this poorly performing school district. Their highly-engaged parents recognize that their children could do better academically if they were concentrated in a separate school with other students having similarly-engaged parents. Hence why they fight so hard for tracking, magnetic school, charter schools, and other sorting mechanisms. Is it just for us to trade that away in the name of egalitarianism?

Beyond the fairness question for students, we must also consider the political implications of failing to manage these parents' desire for more educational sorting. Not only will they be a potent political force, should they lose the political fight, they’re better positioned to exit the public school system; either by private school enrollment or moving. So we’ll get some amount of sorting regardless. Worse, we risk losing their political support for public education in general or forfeiting their tax dollars.

Would it not be better to meet these parents' needs through more aggressive educational sorting within the public school system through mechanisms like tracking and magnet schools?"

I agree that they would find that offensive in a fashion akin to colonialism. Instead, I think they’re imagining something like stronger students helping weaker students through peer tutoring.

But there won’t even be the possibility for peer tutoring, or even teacher instruction, if classroom order isn’t maintained. Hence, the need for something like “benevolent colonialism” or even just simply removing the few disruptive students until their behavior improves. Eg, assign in-school suspensions where offenders have to hand-copy encyclopedias all day. Something so excruciatingly boring will get many, if not all, to shape up.

And beyond this, I'm unconvinced that progressive activists, who profess concern for education, genuinely prioritize enhancing the academic performance of the most disadvantaged students. Rather, they seem to be primarily focused on identifying disparities and then blaming the school and society at large. Notably, because these activists seem to be assuaged by policies that simply hide the disparities. Eg, less measurement through testing.

So I don’t think these activists will be swayed to support these behavioral interventions, which they find abhorrent, by appealing to the benefits for academic performance."

Ie, the European Central Bank has to set a single uniform monetary policy for a collection of countries with fragmented fiscal policies. Eg, what is best for Germany may be suboptimal for Italy.

Ideally, the eurozone would move towards a more unified fiscal policy. The Next Generation EU—an economic recovery package in the wake of the pandemic—is a promising move in that direction. But domestic politics will be a strong headwind in that direction. Eg, why Merkel felt compelled to push austerity on Greece and other periphery EZ nations in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. But as Yglesias explains, that was worse for all countries.

What the EZ ultimately needs is a proper fiscal union with large fiscal transfers from prosperous northern countries to the struggling southern ones. This would be comparable to the large fiscal transfer between California and Alabama in the US. With this single fiscal policy, the ECB could then create the appropriate monetary policy.

But domestic politics in these wealthy northern countries, particularly Germany, would never allow for that; even though these benefactors would also soon become even more prosperous with such a proposal. The nationalist currents within Europe are just far too strong."

Conversely, money and connections have a greater impact on bolstering their children's admission profiles through extracurricular activities.

I just changed the algorithm that groups comments together to search for a hierarchy of categories.

Historically, leaders from our different factions would negotiate out a cogent and realistic agenda in private (ie, smoke-filled rooms). Each would understand the need to at times defer some of their goals as part of the broader plan and long-term success. Further, these leaders could sell this approach to their constituents by highlighting previous victories achieved through our coalition and ongoing commitment to the faction’s enduring objectives.

Yet that is impossible today, primarily due to social media and the fragmented media and policy space. For example, if a formal labor leader attempted to pitch this approach to their members, they’d be crucified across social media, particularly by amateur journalists and NGOs. This is a concrete example from Nov 2022 in, “Railroad unions struggle to get rebellious workers to ‘yes’ on contracts.” [1]

I’m becoming increasingly concerned about our looming resolution to this unstable arrangement. Particularly as each group comes to see their supposed victories as nothing more than cheap messaging. Eg, when the child care stipulations added to CHIPS Act funding are no longer seen as a success from the policy groups pushing it when they discover that it accomplishes so little. Generalize this trend across all groups and each will become increasingly frustrated with our coalition. That could lead to even more inflammatory rhetoric and even less willingness to negotiate.

My fear is that groups and their constituents will become increasingly disillusioned and disengaged with the political process. We already have some of that from former Bernie supporters that now just attack Biden and the Democratic party, while espousing cynicism with the American political system.

Data@Urban Blog, available at: https://urban-institute.medium.com/how-urban-piloted-data-science-techniques-to-collect-land-use-reform-data-475409903b88

Here are some key points from that blog post (ignore anything that sounds too technical):
* They fetched 76k news articles by searching for some key words
* They had 4 people manually label 568 of these articles with tags
* Tags aren’t list, but include topics like, “single-family housing, mixed residential and nonresidential development, accessory dwelling units and granny flats”
* They extract features (eg, word counts) from the text using Stanford CoreNLP and a TF-IDF transformation is applied
* They take top 15% of terms by frequency (don’t give a count of features)
* Train a random forest classifier 
* They get a “75–91 percent accuracy” for tag prediction

My biggest complaint is the lack of details. That may be appropriate for a blogpost, but I would expect scholarly work to meticulously detail their methods. The post would be an acceptable summary of such a detailed peer-reviewed article, but they still need that article.

Next, 568 labeled data points is an extremely small dataset for text classification. Particularly when predicting multiple labels. Maybe there’s some cutting edge AI method that could work with that, but not a random forest of term frequency features.

Their saving grace may be that they aren’t actually using the model results. Quoting from the blog post,
> Ultimately, we determined the machine learning algorithm performed well, but it was not accurate enough to inform policy analysis directly. Because we wanted to predict several outcomes from the articles, even our relatively high 75–91 percent accuracy rate meant the odds that all fields in a given row were accurate were still quite low. For instance, if we predict six fields in a given row, each with a 75 percent accuracy rate, (and assume prediction errors are independent), the odds that every field is correct in that row is 0.75⁶, or just 18 percent.
> But we determined that the model did work well enough to narrow down the set of articles that we could have experts manually tag to a much smaller number: thousands as opposed to tens of thousands. Our experts manually tagged these remaining articles for a smaller number of metro areas with the best coverage, correcting the machine learning model as necessary or leaving the predictions intact and moving on quickly where it had gotten the predictions right.

My charitable interpretation is that they checked the work of the ML model. Ie, for every prediction a human verified if it was correct, and if not they changed it. We might say that the model provides helpful suggestions, but ultimately human judgment is used to label all of the articles used in this study.

Again, this is just a blog post and very light on details. I would very much appreciate it if the main, peer-reviewed study just said that they used human-labeling of news articles, with helpful suggestions from a toy ML model.

Term frequency is the most basic method and can be acceptable for some tasks, but generally quite limited in performance. There are now large-language-model-derived methods that can do a much better job quantifying semantic meaning into a list of numerical features. Eg, text-embedding-ada-002 from OpenAI, https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings

I’ve used that OpenAI method for my assorted SB comment analysis projects that I’ve shared in the daily threads, and it does way better than my earlier naive attempts using term frequencies. I didn’t even share most of those earlier projects since they gave such embarrassingly bad results."

In my opinion, this backlash is not sufficiently considered in the subsequent alternative history narrative. Notably, the Tea Party is totally absent despite it being a significant political force in our actual history, and I recall its chief concern was big government.

I think it’s important to remember that we saw the precursor to this movement even before the Great Recession was felt in the strong Republican opposition to the Bush administration’s TARP bill in 2008, with House Republicans voting 133–65 against in the first vote. [1] This predates the large spike in unemployment, [2] so it seems almost certain we’d get a Tea-Party-like opposition to government largess regardless.

In our actual history that movement only grew strong with the ACA passage in 2010. Adding a large government stimulus in 2009 would’ve only thrown more fuel on the fire. Further, we wouldn’t have our actual counterfactual of poor economic recovery. Pundits and politicians could claim economic recovery would’ve happened regardless and therefore branded the larger ARRA as further government overreach and waste.

Hence, I think it’s likely that this alternative history includes a stronger Tea Party, and that could possibly put Romney/Ryan into the Whitehouse in 2012 with solid Republican margins in Congress. Worse, they might have the political capital to not only rollback the ACA, but also begin the privatization of Social Security. 

And the most troubling harm in this alternative history would be repudiation of Obama’s ambitious political strategy to expand our social safety net. This would be seen as a confirmation that Bill Clinton’s Third Way approach was the only viable strategy for Democrats.

I don't think people recognize the extreme level of OpSec sophistication necessary to protect their anonymity online. This includes constant diligence to never post anything that could partially reveal their real identity. Even just a few unrelated comments on one’s profession, local political concerns, and hobbies could allow an acquaintance to connect the dots. And there are creepy online communities dedicated to doxing their enemies through such “intelligence operations”.

Worse, you have to consider the risks of a data breach on the platform. Eg, all of us paid subscribers have provided Substack with our email address and billing info, including our real name. Ideally, Stripe is firewalling identity information from Substack and writers, but a cursory search suggests that billing addresses can be collected. [1] Even then, large and reputable tech companies have had breaches.

Hence, as a software engineer, I’ve decided that I cannot guarantee my own online anonymity and therefore use my real name for all online discussions. Without even the illusion of anonymity, I’m far less likely to sloppily say anything I wouldn’t ever want tied back to my name.

There is a related concept in statistics called the “Curse of Dimensionality.” To illustrate this, imagine you describe a sample of people by just age and income, and visualize that in a 2D plot. Most of the data points will be in the center of the figure since few people are an outlier in either age or income. Yet, if we add more dimensions, such as hours of TV per week or miles walked per month, fewer and fewer people will be in the center of this multiple-dimensional space because more and more people will be an outlier on at least one of the dimensions. Most people will still be in the center of the majority of dimensions, for each individual dimension, because most people are within the norm.

I think a lot of cultural fragmentation can be explained by the ever-increasing number of dimensions that contribute to each of our identities. While we will all be an outlier on one or more dimensions with respect to the general population, or even just our friends, we should remember that we are still all quite normal across the majority of dimensions. Eg, almost all of us prefer temperate weather than extremes of hot or cold."

> What distinguishes Matthew Yglesias as a writer? Particularly with respect to other Democrat-aligned writers of his generation.

And ChatGPT-4 responds with something fairly reasonable:

Matthew Yglesias is an American journalist, blogger, and political commentator who has been influential in shaping the discourse around progressive policy and politics. While he is generally aligned with the Democratic Party, there are several aspects that distinguish him from other Democrat-aligned writers of his generation:

1. Breadth of interests: Yglesias covers a wide range of topics, including economics, housing policy, urban planning, healthcare, education, and foreign policy. This wide-ranging expertise allows him to offer a more comprehensive perspective on policy issues compared to some of his contemporaries who may focus on narrower areas.

2. Wonkish approach: Yglesias is known for his detailed, data-driven analysis of policy issues, which sets him apart from some other writers who might focus more on the political or cultural aspects of a story. His wonkish approach often provides readers with a more nuanced understanding of policy debates.

3. Pragmatism: While Yglesias is aligned with the Democratic Party, he often takes a pragmatic approach to policy discussions, highlighting areas where compromise might be possible or advocating for more incremental changes. This can differentiate him from some writers who may advocate for more ideologically-driven positions.

4. Willingness to challenge orthodoxy: Yglesias is not afraid to critique or challenge the prevailing wisdom within the Democratic Party, which sets him apart from some writers who may be more inclined to toe the party line. This willingness to question conventional wisdom can result in fresh insights and original perspectives.

5. Engaging writing style: Yglesias is known for his clear and accessible writing style, which can make complex policy issues more understandable for a wider audience. This approachability helps to differentiate him from some other political writers, whose work may be more academic or difficult for the general reader to engage with.

6. Online presence: Yglesias has a strong presence across various digital platforms, including Twitter and his own newsletter, Slow Boring. This enables him to engage with readers and share his thoughts in real-time, setting him apart from some of his contemporaries who may have a more traditional or limited online presence."

I discover inaccuracies by applying the learnings in realtime to toy problems and exercises. Same way in which I’d use a book, online tutorial, or StackOverflow answer. All of these, including ChatGPT, have mistakes. By applying the advice in exercises, I can get real time feedback about what works, and ask the AI to correct any mistakes I discover.

For example, I have zero professional frontend programming experience. As an exercise, I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot (AI-autocomplete in the editor) to implement an interactive webpage to visualize some Slow Boring comment statistics using TypeScript and D3.js. I was amazed at how quickly I picked up these foreign concepts, particularly because I had previously struggled with simpler D3 visualizations many years ago.

Should we have implemented price controls and voters were outraged over the resulting shortages, then these charlatans could easily manufacture a deluge of conspiracy theories to indict corporate America.

Further, they are primarily responding to the incentives of their audience capture. There is simply a strong demand among a segment of media consumers for anti-capitalism content. Sirota and Reich are no different from Tucker Carlson in this aspect, as they are all preaching to the converted.

Similar to Carlson, left-branded economic misinformation can rarely be corrected through debunking and fact-checking. Those endeavors may be useful for saving some people from falling down into the rabbit hole of lies. But in general, most people consuming this content already believe and are simply looking for a reaffirmation of their world view.

In my opinion, the best we can hope for is that the good-old-fashioned leftist circular firing squad continues to keep fragmenting and dividing their audience.

I struggle to square this call to regulate AI development with the rest of the article that lists numerous ways in which short-sighted regulation has hobbled our advancements in the physical world. If such regulation were even possible, would it not just recreate the same situation we currently face with nuclear power? Ie, an incredibly powerful technology, irrationally restrained by superstitious fears.

But even more fundamentally, regulating AI is a fool's errand. Chiefly because there’s already been extremely fast progress in the development of open source AI models that can run on consumer grade hardware, including both image generation [1] and large language models. [2] Ie, anyone can spend a few thousand dollars on a graphics card and start using these tools today, independently. These methods will only improve in capabilities and computational efficiency, while the associated hardware gets cheaper and more powerful. AI will thereby become increasingly available to run locally for anyone with a computer or phone.

We’re never gonna stop deepfakes nor spam bots since unscrupulous actors will just ignore any regulations. At best regulation can prevent reputable firms from commercializing these technologies. Yet I think we should prefer large, well-resourced firms, with reputations to maintain and legal liabilities to minimize, lead the rollout of these novel technologies. The alternative is people seeking out unregulated, open-source AI tools that they can run locally should regulation exclude corporate commercialization.

Ultimately, adaptation is our only option for managing AI advancements. We cannot stop bad actors, but instead we’ll need to adjust our own behavior to mitigate their harm. Eg, put zero trust in images, audio, and video that isn’t directly reported by reputable sources. Similarly, each institution and individual needs to be thoughtful in their experimentation and rollout of AI technologies, including managing the downsides for their unique risk profile.

Yet with AI, we can finally perform that replacement and drop costs by orders of magnitude, while expanding availability, quality, and consistency.

There could be numerous downstream economic benefits. For example, housing costs in large metro areas could fall because we no longer need to concentrate so many people in specific cities for the benefits of agglomeration.

Further, because so many of us are relatively rich and comfortable, we are tempted by status quo bias. Sure, maybe things could be better, possibly primarily for some other people that we ostentatiously care about, but we certainly don’t want to risk losing all the great stuff we currently have.

So maybe it would be sensible to accept our political gridlock with respect to the physical world? Maybe we should even embrace our post-material politics and see just how weird and fascinating things can get."

We can’t do anything to improve daycare efficiency for the time being, but that is already an unskilled role. Similarly, it’s possible education could use more low or unskilled labor if AI can provide domain-specific expertise for teaching.

Further, the cost efficiency of many other services can be improved when we expand the pool of labor for these industries by eliminating numerous roles in other industries through AI capital-labor substitutions. Eg, there is currently a shortage of care workers for the elderly and we could greatly expand that labor pool if we eliminated the mass majority of administrators across numerous institutions like higher education."

Just the geopolitical and national defense concerns should be sufficiently alarming, let alone the domestic politics and reelection ones.

Can institutional inertia alone fully explain this? I'm not questioning Yglesias' sources or his capacity to elucidate the issue's structure based on them. This just seems like something the administration could easily identify and correct on their own due to the high stakes of an OPEC+ oil price surge at such an inopportune time.

Could there instead be something of a disagreement within the Biden administration about balancing the rivalrous concerns of geopolitics, climate, economics, and electoral politics?

I think this is an example of a topic Ezra Klein discussed with Nicholas Bagley in his podcast episode, “How Liberals — Yes, Liberals — Are Hobbling Government”, https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-nicholas-bagley.html

One of the key themes that Bagley highlighted is that highly bureaucratization processes and procedures seem more legitimate than allowing executive discretion. Further, with these rules, a poor outcome can be explained as a failure of process, suggesting the need for more rules, rather than a bad judgment call from an executive or an administrator. It also shields these individuals from political blowback since they can always blame the procedures rather than have to own up to a mistake.

> And a lot of that anxiety in the United States has been filtered into the creation of really strict procedural rules to discipline agencies — and stricter rules than are in place in many other developed countries. And part of the reason is that we think those rules are necessary to give agencies legitimacy, to make them accountable. And when we’re anxious about the exercise of state power — and there’s a lot of anxiety about state power running through the American political culture — the thought is that these procedures can cleanse the bureaucracy of some of the things that make us nervous about it."

Columbia Law School professor Lev Menand argues, in a recent Odd Lots episode, [1] that the Fed has become overly reliant on rigid rules and procedure and has forfeited their discretionary authority to intervene.

> We can distinguish between regulation, which are bright line rules put down in advance, and supervision, which is discretionary safety and soundness oversight by examiners and federal officials. Both the bright line rules and supervision failed here. There was an overreliance on the bright line rules and a failure to do the discretionary oversight effectively.

> We used to just do discretionary safety and soundness oversight. The real question here is how come the supervisors didn't pick up on the fact that SVB had gamed the rules to take on a lot of interest-rate risk without holding an adequate amount of capital against it. It's a pretty obvious maneuver and not a novel one. You would think any seasoned supervisor looking at the balance sheet could pick up on this quickly. So, what happened? I think the answer requires maybe 20 or 30 years worth of history to understand because contemporary supervision is broken in some sense, and this is a manifestation of that.

He explains that this situation resulted from banks suing the Fed in the 80s about unfair and inconsistent supervisory interventions, and congress responded with a statute that incentivized rules to eliminate legal challenges.
 
> Some banks sued, one bank was able to prevail in the Fifth Circuit, and Congress intervened and passed a new law authorizing ex-ante, bright-line capital rules for the first time and saying that capital judgments of supervisors can't be second-guessed by courts. And so in an accidental way, you have the birth of capital regulation. The supervisors are overwhelmed, and there are lawsuits, and you have Congress saying, actually, just write a rule that the banks all have to comply with so that you don't have to get into litigation over whether this bank or that bank is undercapitalized.

I agree with this framing in terms of marketing for paid subscription, particularly, “The New York Times and especially the Washington Post marketed newspaper subscriptions as a form of resistance.” But I think CNN and Fox News aren’t aiming for such high-minded branding. Instead, I think they are just striving to create addictive content, similar to social media algorithmic feeds.

These cable networks are in fierce competition with social media, alternative media outlets, and even streaming platforms for peoples’ limited attention in a world of infinite content.

We might get this one without expending any political capital if SCOTUS strikes the plans down.

Bloomberg is reporting that, “The Supreme Court is likely to announce a decision on President Joe Biden’s forgiveness plan in the coming weeks”, as “The court typically recesses at the end of June, so any decision is most likely to come before then.” https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/when-do-student-loan-payments-restart-supreme-court-ruling-on-biden-plan-nears

Notably, the 1951 Treasury-Fed Accord with the Truman administration established US central bank independence. https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/treasury-fed-accord

Prior to that, the Fed was willing to peg bond yields down for treasuries (ie, yield curve control) to aid in war financing. Truman and his Treasury Secretary wanted to continue that in order to manage the debt load, and they tried to bully the Fed into compliance. The administration released a false press release claiming that such an agreement had been met, and they were deeply embarrassed when Fed Governor Eccles leaked the actual meeting notes to the press.

The Fed is now institutionally committed to price stability, and for good reasons. If they even hinted at eschewing this responsibility then we’d risk a sovereign debt crisis as global investors started dumping US treasuries and other dollar-denominated assets."

121811900,Elon Musk is wrong about George Soros and Magneto,https://www.slowboring.com/p/elon-musk-magneto-soros,16251059,Matt Hagy,3094604,2023-05-18 06:20:02-04:00,18,0,14,,,16251059,14,-12,,"For others’ that are also unfamiliar with the X-Men lore, here’s how ChatGPT-4 answers, “Describe the conflict between Xavier and Magneto”:

Professor Charles Xavier (often known as Professor X) and Erik Lehnsherr (also known as Magneto) are two central characters in the Marvel Comics universe, most notably in the X-Men series. Despite both being mutants and sharing common goals of mutant prosperity, they have divergent philosophies and methods, which results in a significant, ongoing conflict throughout the series.

Professor Xavier believes in peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans. He thinks that mutants should use their powers responsibly to help humanity and foster understanding and acceptance. Xavier's goal is to create a world where humans and mutants live together harmoniously, and he seeks to achieve this by educating mutants at his school (the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters) to control their powers and to use them in a way that benefits all of society.

On the other hand, Magneto views mutants as a superior species and humans as a threat to mutant survival. He believes that mutants must assert their power and dominance to survive and protect themselves. Magneto's experiences, particularly his early life during the Holocaust, have led him to this more militant and separatist approach.

This ideological clash is the root of their conflict. Despite their common goal of wanting what's best for mutants, their different perspectives and strategies cause them to often be at odds with each other. 

Xavier forms the X-Men, a group of mutants who follow his philosophy and work towards peaceful coexistence. Magneto, meanwhile, often leads the Brotherhood of Mutants, a group that seeks to advance the status of mutants, even at the cost of human welfare.

Their conflict symbolizes larger societal issues, such as the tension between assimilation and separatism, between peace and violence in the struggle for civil rights, and between different visions of what an ideal society looks like. Despite their differences, however, there are instances where they come together to face common threats against mutantkind."

Interestingly, both of their politics include some suspicion of the state, just in different venues. Soros is concerned about abuses in policing and incarceration, while Thiel is opposed to democracy in general, particularly when it limits his wealth and power. Hence, both are financing efforts to curtail state power (among other political projects).

It seems reasonable to me for people to be angry with these mega-political-financiers due to political disagreements. Yet, I believe critics of both commonly overestimate the impact of these two individuals, incorrectly identifying them as a root cause for a broader political movement. Trumpism could exist without Thiel, as could Defund without Soros. I believe it counterproductive to put so much blame on individuals, regardless of their wealth and power, because it distracts from understanding and countering their more general political opponents."

The SEC’s complaint alleges that, in truth, Musk had not discussed specific deal terms with any potential financing partners, and he allegedly knew that the potential transaction was uncertain and subject to numerous contingencies. According to the SEC’s complaint, Musk’s tweets caused Tesla’s stock price to jump by over six percent on August 7, and led to significant market disruption.
