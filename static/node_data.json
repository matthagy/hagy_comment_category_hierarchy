  "summary": "The comments from this author can be summarized into a few main themes. First, the author expresses concern over the disproportionate amount of power held by liberal and progressive elites within the Democratic party, particularly those in journalism and academia. The author worries that this could push these elites further away from the average Democratic voter and create opportunities for right-wing populists to exploit. \n\nSecond, the author provides insights into topics ranging from the decline of atheism on the internet, to the sophistication of comments on various substacks, to the potential of a muscular welfare state to improve capitalism. They also offer recommendations, such as urging readers to check out a Vanity Fair article on the current \"thought leadership\" of the American right. \n\nFinally, the author provides analysis and suggestions on matters related to policy and finance. For instance, they suggest that the debt ceiling is unconstitutional and that a platinum coin fallback could be a potential solution to prevent global financial meltdown in the event of a judiciary decision against the Treasury. Throughout their comments, the author utilizes precise language and detailed analysis to provide readers with thoughtful insights.",

      "summary": "The author of these comments covers a wide range of topics from finance, politics, and food production. Regarding finance, the author comments on the collapse of FTX and crypto in general, highlighting the lack of regulation and connection to the real economy in the toy financial system. In politics, the author criticizes the GOP for their lack of strategy in cutting spending and their potential role in leading the US into a financial crisis. The author also suggests a solution to the debt ceiling issue in the form of a platinum coin fallback. The author's comments on food production relate to the decrease in egg prices due to the end of the bird flu outbreak and the increase in refining costs contributing to higher gasoline prices. Overall, the author provides nuanced and informed opinions on a variety of topics.",

Some commenters propose using premium bonds to solve the problem, while others suggest challenging the constitutionality of the debt ceiling or using a platinum coin as a fail-safe. Many of the commenters express concern about the potential consequences of not raising the debt ceiling, which they see as a matter of global financial stability. The Treasury market, in particular, is viewed as highly significant and vulnerable to disruption. Some commenters suggest that the debt ceiling issue reflects a broader problem with the US fiscal system and advocate for a more unified fiscal policy. Finally, some commenters discuss the role of the US dollar in global trade and financing, including its status as the premiere funding currency, and the benefits and costs associated with its use as a global reserve currency.",

          "summary": "The author of these comments provides a range of insights into the current crisis of SVB and broader banking regulations. They argue that focusing solely on aspects like deregulation is likely a mistake, and that there are multiple regulations and constraints that banks operate under. These mostly revolve around ensuring that banks have enough high quality, liquid assets to cover their liabilities, which in turn impact their lending and investment activities. \n\nThe author is also skeptical of potential bailouts, believing that the FDIC and associated agencies are well-equipped to stabilize the situation and that startups should have anticipated the risk of forgoing treasury operations by banking with SVB. They argue that future startups may be incentivized to implement basic treasury operations in light of the crisis. Overall, they suggest that there may be more regulation on bank balance sheets than some conspiracy theorists suggest, and that a range of financial services alternatives exist that give savers more upside and exposure to investment risks.",

They criticize FTX's balance sheet, stating that it is impossible for FTX to fulfill its liabilities, especially with its overvalued assets. They also mention several articles and podcasts that discuss the FTX case.\n\nThe author presents an interesting argument about the nature of the crypto industry, calling it a \"toy financial system\" that was never connected to the real economy nor based on hard assets. They argue that the financial value assigned to crypto assets was entirely speculation about future utility. They further highlight the benefits of having a contained financial system that can serve as an outlet for financial gambling.\n\nFinally, the author also briefly discusses the issues of insider trading and accountability during the financial crisis. They argue that while there was accountability for the banks in the form of Dodd-Frank regulations, it was hard to hold anyone individually accountable because no one was breaking the law.",

They also discuss the impact of inflation on workers' wages and advocate for pragmatic solutions to managing COVID-19 while also normalizing the goods/services spending balance. Additionally, they provide insights into the Fed's use of inflation forecasts to guide monetary policy and point out the difficulties of predicting the trajectory of inflation during periods of high economic volatility. The author also stresses the importance of maintaining central bank credibility and explains why a loss of credibility can lead to economic volatility and pain. Finally, they offer context to understand why the Fed is projecting restrictive monetary policy throughout 2023 and why the Fed is not declaring victory on inflation.",

Firstly, the author believes that Republicans do not have real plans for addressing inflation and instead attack Democrats' policies. Secondly, the author believes that climate change issues cannot be solved by taking actions at the intersection of finance and climate, which needs good policy to work within the current political reality. Thirdly, the author argues that Democrats need to expand their tax base and redirect resources from private consumption so that they can build a strong welfare state. Fourthly, the author suggested that Adam Tooze\u2019s 2018 book \u201cCrashed\u201d provides a good coverage of the insane politicking around the TARP legislation. Fifthly, the author thinks that Trump will be a defining feature in the Republican primary and will instruct his supporters to refrain from voting in the general election.",

In one comment, they express support for political leaders who took action to prevent a total market meltdown during the crisis, praising Pelosi's leadership and criticizing Republican opposition to the TARP bailout. Another comment discusses the potential consequences of a stronger Tea Party movement in response to a larger government stimulus package in 2009 and the possible repudiation of Obama's political strategy. \n\nThe author also provides commentary on economic policy in general, including the Federal Reserve's recent hawkish pivot and democratic politicians' criticism of monetary policy. They express some skepticism about specific figures, such as Summers and Yellen, and suggest that certain criticisms of them may be based on misconceptions. They also question whether the recent leak about Yellen's initial concerns with the size of the ARP may be an attempt to scapegoat her for current inflation issues.",

They express concern that the Democrats are not doing enough to address the issue of inflation which is considered the number one issue for many voters. They believe that the Democrats need to develop a serious plan to address inflation, such as Skanda Amarnath\u2019s plan to rapidly expand the supply of key commodities, chiefly energy, to counter the narrative that the Republicans offer better economic policy. \n\nIn addition to this, the author expresses their views on the idea of cutting entitlements and the effects of tax reform. They argue that people in the Democratic party, particularly the upper-middle class, are prioritizing their interests over those of the working class, making it difficult to increase taxes on the merely affluent to expand the welfare state. The author also has a strong interest in historical and political analysis, providing insights into specific events such as the nullification crisis faced by Andrew Jackson and the contentious presidential election of 1876. \n\nOverall, the author appears to be an engaged and politically-aware individual, sharing nuanced insights and critiques of different political ideas and actions. While they are critical of some aspects of the Democratic party, they do not align themselves explicitly with any one party or ideology, and instead offer their own independent perspectives on the issues at hand.",

The author argues that fighting against the domestic oil and gas industry is a counterproductive approach, and instead advocates for policies that both accelerate the green transition and promote a healthy respect for the domestic oil and gas industry. The author suggests policies like decreasing oil volatility by expanding the strategic petroleum reserve, and making loans to oil and gas firms for increasing production and processing capacity. The author acknowledges the constraints of political reality, including the need to consider the price of energy and to work within these constraints when addressing climate change.\n\nIn addition, the author criticizes academic exercises like the Raskin op-ed, which advocates for denying emergency support to the fossil fuel sector in hopes of bankrupting the industry, and suggests that there are no clever tricks to address climate change. The author also questions the effectiveness of a carbon tax and dividend policy, noting that it may be seen by voters as simply raising the cost of energy. Finally, the author criticizes the lack of action to address climate change, highlighting the need for policy that considers constraints and tradeoffs.",

They encourage others, including the writer of the article they are commenting on, to take advantage of tax benefits and deductions that may be available to them, suggesting that consulting with a small business accountant might be helpful.\n\nThe author is careful to separate tax avoidance from illegal tax evasion, acknowledging that wealthy individuals and businesses may engage in legal tax shelters and tax avoidance strategies to minimize their tax burden. They argue that the issue is not one of wealthy individuals cheating on their taxes but rather structural issues such as the pathologically high estate tax exemption and the legal mechanisms that allow the wealthy to minimize their tax liability.\n\nThroughout their comments, the author writes in a respectful and thoughtful tone, engaging with the content of the articles and adding their own perspectives and experiences.

They argue that this fact should be taken into account when designing policies to address this issue. \n\nOn taxes, they point out that on average, everyone in Germany pays more taxes than people in the US. They argue that more resources should be invested in the public sector by increasing taxes on everyone, and highlight countries that have a high government revenue as a percentage of GDP. \n\nThe author also comments on government spending and deficits. They point out that the US already spends more on healthcare than on defense, and argue that the US's national healthcare problem is a cost problem. They also raise concerns about the deficit impact of the Build Back Better Act and notes that the deficit impact would be much larger if certain programs were made permanent.

They argue that it is essential to recognize the negative externalities of specific populations, such as the homeless, and to use language that clearly separates problematic individuals from the simply downtrodden. The author also acknowledges that individuals can vary in the degree to which they accept pragmatic arguments and that it is important to empathize with those who are politically polarized rather than dismiss them.\n\nAdditionally, the author comments on the subject of machine learning, expressing a desire for more details on specific machine learning models' performance for each tag and advocating for term frequency methods to be replaced with large-language-model-derived methods that can better quantify semantic meaning. Furthermore, the author shares their interest in Singapore's racial policies and their belief that Americans lack comparative perspective on racial or ethnic issues. Finally, the author notes Kathryn Paige Harden's book and her relevant research but emphasizes that the research does not imply that \"poor people are genetically inferior\".

The author argues that certain anti-establishment leftists, who are characterized as having an \"anti-rule-enforcement\" mindset, would be better suited to a libertarian or anarchist political allegiance. They also criticize progressives who graduated from elite universities that benefit from exclusivity and privilege. Additionally, the author argues that some progressive activists are more incentivized by fundraising than by making real progress towards their goals.\n\nAnother theme in the author's comments is a concern for the level of political polarization and extremism in American politics. The author notes that many people view politics through a moral lens and are not interested in compromise or cooperation with people on the other side of the aisle. There is also a concern that some right-wing intellectuals are promoting anti-democracy and anti-liberal ideas that are infiltrating the Republican Party.\n\nFinally, the author offers some thoughts on political messaging and strategy, advocating for a popularism strategy that avoids alienating language and occasionally courts controversy. They suggest that the Democratic Party needs to find ways to appeal to moderate and swing voters without abandoning its principles.",

They provide an example of the cost-benefit analysis in healthcare to illustrate this point. Additionally, the author believes that parents should have near-complete sovereignty over their children, except in extreme cases where their actions would permanently damage the child. \n\nThe author also explores the appeal of degrowth and eco-asceticism to some individuals, admitting that they struggle to empathize with the desire to make anyone materially poorer. They posit that rejection of material wealth can sometimes be a form of ego defense mechanism. The author also discusses the rise and fall of the New Atheism movement on the early internet, believing that it provided a sense of community and contributed to a feeling of rebellion among its members.\n\nFurthermore, the author believes that all relationships, including sexual ones, are transactional in some ways, even if not necessarily financial. They argue that prostitution should not be stigmatized as it is just a more transparent example of transactional relationships, which exist in all forms of relationships. Lastly, the author disputes the concept of \u201cauthentic preferences,\" believing that the mind is a combination of conscious thinking and subconscious impulses, and that neither is more authentic than the other.",

              "summary": "The author of these comments is interested in the work of Kathryn Paige Harden, as discussed in her book \"The Genetic Lottery\". The author indicates that they found a transcript of a recent interview with Harden informative, and appreciated the podcast. They ask whether the research has influenced the interviewer's thinking about government policy for achieving better and fairer social outcomes, and how Harden's work challenges traditional liberal views that expanding education can ameliorate poverty. \n\nThe author notes that, according to Harden, innate genetic components may impact career success. As a result, the author suggests that downplaying educational expansion as a means to addressing poverty and proposing more redistribution to directly improve people\u2019s material conditions may be more useful. The author is also concerned that conservatives might use the same scientific facts to argue for a revitalization of social Darwinism, and questions whether drawing attention to these scientific findings in political debates could backfire. They ask whether Democrats should embrace Harden's moral argument for society/government to ensure everyone lives a life of dignity without material deprivation due to the inherent unfairness of the genetic lottery. \n\nThe author is clear to emphasize that none of this research implies \"poor people are genetically inferior\". They suggest that Harden's book highlights the fact that variation among people is a good thing, but our social systems can unfairly reward and punish people for variations that may have at least a partial genetic component. They argue that neither sibling should be massively rewarded nor penalized in their dignity and quality of life due to their luck of the genetic lottery.",

They critique what they see as a tendency among some American leftists to deny such considerations, framing this as a potentially frustrating obstacle to pragmatic problem solving. Additionally, the author is interested in exploring the appeal of degrowth as an idea and why it might resonate with certain people despite the potential downsides of materially impoverishing oneself. \n\nThe author also shows a nuanced understanding of moral psychology and the role that intuition and emotion can play in shaping political values and beliefs. They cite Jonathan Haidt's work on this topic and question whether attempts to change others' political values through reasoned argument are often futile. Furthermore, the author questions assumptions around monogamy and explores the possibility that open relationships may be a better fit for some couples than trying to adhere to exclusive monogamy. Finally, they reflect on the rise and fall of the \"New Atheism\" movement in the early days of the internet, and the sense of community and belonging that it offered to those who participated in it.",

They also mention a Vox article by Haidt discussing the way that supporters of different politicians focus on different moral concepts.\n\nThe author also praises Haidt's book \"The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom\" for its insight on the subconscious thought and emotions in shaping our perception of the world. They point out how a lot of our rational thought is narrative-building around our initial intuitions, and that we cannot force ourselves into feeling a specific way nor eliminate a biased perception of reality. They highlight the importance of mindfulness in managing the negativity bias that emerges from responses to threats and unpleasantness.\n\nThe author finishes by pointing out how emotions and intuitions come first, and then reasoning is used to construct a socially acceptable narrative that validates the feelings and resulting behaviour. They suggest accepting and exploring our feelings, then inspecting our current justifying narratives to see if they are consistent with our values or factual understanding. Finally, they recommend discussing any dilemmas with respected interlocutors to slowly change our intuitions.",

The author refers to the show \"South Park\" to describe how evolution was taught by a teacher who thinks it is \"a bunch of bullcrap\" but has to teach it anyway. The TV show includes debates around teaching evolution and religion, and Richard Dawkins is also featured. Another topic discussed by the author is the rise and fall of atheism on the internet. The author recalls how active discussions and essays about religion and evolution were in the early days of the internet. However, the internet became a place to express political views rather than to engage in discussions. Finally, the author shares his perspective on religion's role in social groups.

On the other hand, another commenter believes that the left is unwilling to acknowledge constraints and tradeoffs in their policy decisions.\n\nAnother set of comments focuses on the appeal of degrowth and eco-asceticism. One commenter suggests that the motivation behind degrowth may stem from a desire to reject material comforts as a form of sour grapes. However, the commenter acknowledges their theory is likely biased and self-serving. The group of comments also touches on the role of social media in contributing to the deterioration of mental health, particularly among adolescent girls.

The author also shares a personal experience of taking fiber supplements to control their appetite and unintentionally losing 5 pounds in one month.\n\nThe author references a CDC report that shows an inverse correlation between women's income and obesity, but not for men.

The author also questions the effectiveness of shaming unhealthy dietary habits as a means of preventing obesity, referencing their personal experience of quitting smoking due to shame but acknowledging that shaming may not work for everyone.\n\nFinally, the author expresses the opinion that knowledge alone is insufficient in maintaining a healthy weight and that it requires a fair amount of conscious focus, time, and effort.

The author also expresses support for euthanasia in some cases and is troubled by the lack of a legal option for it. \n\nThe author's position on open relationships is nuanced; they do not fully agree with Dan Savage's argument but believe that it should not be dismissed outright. They acknowledge the challenges of monogamy and emphasize the importance of considering non-monogamous options early in a relationship and revisiting the conversation as it evolves. The author also takes issue with Bergner's argument against the medical and social approach to psychosis, arguing that some cases may require antipsychotic medication and involuntary commitment. \n\nThe author supports internalizing costs to regulate behavior rather than broad restrictions, such as with age-restricting internet porn. They propose empowering parents to better regulate their children's internet and screen usage through restricted devices and app-specific controls. Lastly, the author acknowledges differences in ethical beliefs, recognizing that guilt or shame will be ineffective on those with different creeds and that we should all understand the diversity of ethical beliefs.",

They argue that this alliance must be broken and that a more critical Marxist analysis is needed to highlight the class interests at stake. \n\nThe author also discusses a range of ideas related to gun control, including the need for existing laws to be enforced more effectively before advocating for more drastic measures like confiscation and the constitutional reinterpretation of the Second Amendment. They suggest that many Democrats underestimate the strong emotional attachment that many Americans have towards gun ownership and that a backlash against gun control could fire up a pro-gun constituency and alienate potential Democratic voters. \n\nRegarding the global food system, the author highlights the strategic value that China sees in maintaining its large wheat reserves and how this could lead to future geopolitical concessions in exchange for food. They also express concern over the negative externalities of density and the need to address the social problems of homelessness before advocating for more housing abundance. \n\nIn addition, the author discusses the political power of homeowners in creating zoning regulations, the potential for fiscal crises in tech hubs like San Francisco, the rise of nationalism in Russia, and the dangers of relying too heavily on isolated examples like a recent incident in which a woman used a gun to stop a mass shooting.

The author suggests a strategy of advocating for publicly owned and operated SROs to address concerns about capitalistic exploitation and discrimination. Another comment highlights the importance of addressing negative externalities of density and the socially disruptive group of homeless individuals. The author suggests making a distinction between the two groups of homeless individuals to help push for zoning changes that benefit the deserving downtrodden. \n\nIn addition, the author discusses the language used to differentiate between problematic homeless versus working poor and advocates for using terminology that normies recognize. Another comment explores the underlying conservative values of preserving neighborhood character and property values which align with small-c conservatives who support single-family zoning. The author also delves into the economic cost of homeownership and the choice many individuals face between owning more housing or renting less. The final comment discusses the danger of blaming institutional investors, such as BlackRock, for the chaotic housing market, emphasizing that housing undersupply is the result of decades of opposing new home building. \n\nOverall, this author's comments reveal a nuanced understanding of the issues relating to homelessness, zoning reform, and the housing market, as well as the underlying values and motivations that drive opposition to change. They highlight the need for clear language, differentiation between different groups of homeless individuals, and a more comprehensive approach to addressing the housing crisis.",

The author recognizes the strong emotional belief in personal gun ownership for many Americans and sees it as comparable to the right to an abortion. The author also questions the efficacy of gun restrictions in reducing gun violence, suggesting that existing laws are not being enforced, and believes that Republicans still manage to make national elections close due to their geographic advantage.\n\nIn addition, the author argues against the use of guns in situations where non-lethal force could have been used. They cite the case of an Atlanta police officer who was fired and charged with murder after fatally shooting an assailant who stole the officer's taser gun and fired it at officers. The author also mentions a news story about a woman who used her pistol to stop a mass shooting, describing it as the \"dream scenario\" for gun rights activists, but expressing doubt that it is a scalable solution to addressing gun violence.

The author believes that western nations may not be able to convince China to sell off its wheat reserves, which China considers to be a strategic asset. While African and Middle Eastern countries may be ready to make strategic concessions to China for food, in the long term, these concessions could harm global security.\n\nThe author also points out that the US has the potential to replace the lost imports of wheat from Ukraine and Russia with current agricultural productivity. However, the shift to planting soybean and corn instead of wheat is concerning, particularly because the increase in corn crop is used for ethanol production and soybean is used for exporting animal feed to China. \n\nFurthermore, the author discusses the possibility of a US-China conflict over Taiwan and questions whether the US would be willing to break the blockade of Taiwan by sinking Chinese ships. The author is uncertain whether the bipartisan China hawk consensus would lead to war, as both parties may not be willing to declare war on a nuclear power for the benefit of a third country, especially when the US doesn't have a defense treaty with Taiwan.\n\nFinally, discussing MAD (mutually assured destruction), the author points out that countries may not necessarily resort to their MAD options during a hot war, as was seen during WWII when chemical weapons were not used despite their ability to inflict massive damage. The author suggests that a hot war in contested territory could result in millions of deaths without any parties resorting to nuclear weapons.",

On the topic of billionaires, their opinion is that the wealthiest Americans generally got there through entrepreneurship and building firms that provide new goods and services. They also question at what point should a policy failure be performed-when ownership stakes become valued at a billion? The author notes that regulating such companies could hinder the free market and that the majority of billionaires seem committed to giving away the majority of their extreme wealth rather than allowing their heirs to inherit it.\n\nOn the subject of social media, the author believes that peer pressure can play an important role in improving our media consumption habits and suggests that Twitter and TikTok should be viewed as low-class, dirty habits, while higher-quality publications should be viewed with pride. They also suggest that a paid social media offering could be a potential solution. Additionally, the author believes in utilizing bots crackdown, creating multiple clients for Twitter, and is against unnecessary regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe author\u2019s other comments touch on regulatory challenges faced by Substack, an opinion on the coverage of tech companies, the need for a leadership shake-up in Amtrak, and the proposal to unbundle prices for economy airplane seats based on seat location and assigning preferred family seating.",

They do not see NFTs as a wise financial investment, but rather as a collectible item similar to baseball cards. The author is unsure about the purpose of cryptocurrency regulations, but suggests that regulation might limit institutional investment.

Additionally, the author believes that Amtrak leadership needs a significant revamp, perhaps by bringing in foreign experts. They question the policy of attaching further strings to the CHIPS Act funding, given that the US already has structural disadvantages in the chip manufacturing industry. Finally, the author discusses Intel's reorganization struggles and warns that the company will lose manufacturing if it does not demonstrate success soon.",

In response to Elon Musk's right-wing stance on Twitter, the author expressed frustration with Biden's exclusion of Tesla from events promoting the electric vehicle industry, which may have led to a plausible justification for Elon's shift to the right. At the same time, the author acknowledges that Elon's behavior risks distracting him from making Tesla a politically polarizing brand. The second comment praises Elon's ability to make EV adoption a non-partisan issue, with conservatives buying Teslas to stick it to Biden. The next comments express surprise over Biden's position on a railroad strike and his call for Congress to support a tentative agreement between railroad workers and operators. The author notes their expectation of Biden to leverage the strike to meet the union's demands. There is also a discussion of management's aversion to increasing sick leave. The author feels that management should calculate the cost of increased sick leave against the expense of other union demands. The author further discusses the fear that EV adoption may lead to a loss of auto jobs that sparked the first UAW strike against General Motors. In response to a tweet mentioning InfoWars and Kanye West, the author finds the comments incoherent and unfathomably gross. Finally, the author provides their opinion on Elon Musk's rise to power on Twitter and expresses concern about Musk's business interests in China and the possibility that he may suppress information negative to China to please the CCP.",

The author notes that should the reorganization fail, Intel will rely on TSMC for their future production and will have to sell its manufacturing division. However, the author warns that Intel's revenue and margins are dropping faster than they forecast, and if they can't soon demonstrate success in their reorganization strategy, investors will demand that Intel exit manufacturing.\n\nIn the second set of comments, the author expresses concern over the CHIPS Act's regulatory burden, which increases the cost of deploying funds and exacerbates structural deficits in chips manufacturing. The author argues that instead of adding regulatory hurdles, we should be removing them and incentivizing firms to make economically rational decisions, regardless of the source. The author worries that, in 10 years, the CHIPS Act will be seen as accomplishing little at a high expense, highlighting the need for careful planning and efficient deployment of public investment.\n\nOverall, both sets of comments address issues related to the structural challenges of the semiconductor industry in the United States and the government's role in addressing these challenges. While the first set of comments provides specific commentary on Intel's strategy, the second set of comments focuses on the CHIPS Act and its potential impact on the industry.",

They coin 'rage clicks' as a way to describe the increased traffic generated by scandalous news stories, however, they agree that the Democratic System and the Public Broadcasting Service help to reduce the negative effects of internet-driven sensationalism.\n\nRegarding Twitter's content moderation issues, the author suggests separating Twitter into a back-end service that hosts content and a front-end client that provides moderation and algorithmic amplification. They propose creating various clients with different sets of rules and moderation, such as a client designed for journalists that focuses on the filtering of harassment. They also express concern regarding a lack of retention and user growth on Twitter, and suggest that advertisers will consolidate their spending onto the biggest networks, which risks leaving Twitter as an odd network out. Finally, they propose that Twitter includes a mass delete feature to reduce controversy around old tweets.",

They suggest that this would enable experimentation with diverse user preferences and create a range of clients, including highly moderated clients and wild west anything goes clients. The author explores possible clients such as those geared towards journalists, techies, or partisan clients that filter and rank social feeds according to political preference.\n\nThe author also supports Elon Musk's desire to crack down on bots on Twitter, which could lead to a more pleasant user experience and higher ROI on ad impressions. They suggest that this initiative would be difficult for a public corporation to undertake but more feasible for a private company like Twitter. The author also believes that everything we say on the public internet will be preserved for eternity, acting as if everything we add to the internet is permanent. They suggest that people should act as if everything they say online can and will be tied to their public real identity.\n\nFinally, the author views Twitter as a horribly managed business, citing Ben Thompson's 2015 article, \"Twitter Needs New Leadership.\" They note that Twitter's active user growth is too small and that almost nothing was done to improve the product or onboarding experience until recently, when Twitter rolled out a new logged-out page and an instant timeline. The author highlights that Twitter has a debt burden, but this is manageable without the large one-time payment made to settle a class-action lawsuit. They note that the withdrawal of advertisers due to reputational risk on Elon Musk's Twitter is creating a new problem.",

They are particularly supportive of outlets like Bloomberg News, which they believe offer a more fact-based, informative approach to news coverage.\n\nThe author also has concerns about social media and the influence it has on media consumption and public opinion. They argue that social media platforms have the power to shape demand for content in a way that traditional media do not, and that this has negative effects on the quality and objectivity of news coverage.

AWS allowed users to store and access large files, manage billing at a fine-grained level, and offered fully automated tools to control instances - this significantly encouraged cloud computing adoption.\n\nIn the final comment, the author expresses their liking for Amazon's \"subscribe and save\" service for non-perishable consumer goods.

The author argues that Substack's venture capital funding structure is not conducive to a smaller, profitable business, and that VCs may seek a sale if additional funding cannot be secured. Finally, the author suggests that Substack's high valuation may be difficult to maintain or justify, and raises concerns about the potential consequences of a down round.",

They also suggest that feedback helps builds expectations, making it easier for individuals to deliver and receive critique. Meanwhile, the author of the second comment argues that the normalization of the tech labor market will be good in the long run because competition will lead to disruptive new startups and offer more impactful employment opportunities. On the other hand, the third and seventh comments argue against the common belief that education is a great equalizer or vehicle for upward mobility, citing research that suggests student performance is largely predetermined by out-of-school factors like socioeconomic background.\n\nThe remaining comments focus on critiques of existing systems or practices. For instance, the author of the fourth comment questions the usefulness of busing policies, arguing that they were met with backlash from not just affluent whites, but parents across all socioeconomic backgrounds due to the strain it puts on children. The fifth comment critiques the notion that programming is becoming commodified or dumbed down as it is more about solving social problems rather than technical ones. Instead, programmers are leveraging modern programming tools to abstract away technical challenges, allowing for greater productivity and efficiency. Similarly, the author of the sixth comment challenges the notion that education should be the main focus of improving socioeconomic inequality, and instead suggests that income redistribution is a more effective measure. Lastly, the author of the eighth comment critiques defined benefit pensions, arguing that defined contributions are better as they force firms and governments to pay the bill today, and employees have incentives to project realistic or conservative investment returns to ensure adequate funding.",

Firstly, they believe that the recent tech layoffs are simply a correction to the extreme hiring binge of tech companies during the pandemic. There was a massive increase in demand for tech services which led to aggressive hiring, but this hope was dashed as tech usage normalized. However, despite the layoffs, the economic impact and employee count of these companies still exceed pre-pandemic levels.\n\nSecondly, the author discusses the reluctance of tech companies to fire engineers for performance reasons. Engineers are expensive to hire and onboard, possess valuable differential tribal knowledge, and are almost always a positive contribution to the team. Therefore, there is no reason to manage out low performers unless the firm runs into cash flow issues.\n\nLastly, the author discusses their viewpoint on public sector unions. They express concern about their resistance to the expansion of charter schools and their tendency to work with the political system to secure excessive profits in a parasitic, rent-seeking fashion. The author believes unions function best when they compete against other firms, as seen in the German model, instead of undermining competition.",
